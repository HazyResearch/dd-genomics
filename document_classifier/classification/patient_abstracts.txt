and multi-point analysis be perform use carthagene software -lrb- -rrb- . the gene limit the qtl region be then use to identify the homologous region in species with related qtl . the ligand for ENSEMBLGENE be still unknown . it be striking that in human and pig these closely interact molecule be link together , whereas in other species they be on different chromosome . however , gene can also be associate with a divergent phenotype without a related difference in expression . the ENSEMBLGENE enzyme modify a structure that enable specific binding of _ e. coli _ -lrb- ecf18 -rrb- to the intestinal mucosa and therefore could not explain the qtl effect on the non-bacterial pathogen in the other species -lrb- Table . it can therefore be conclude that the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ family gene cluster be the most likely candidate for the overlay qtl . fifty-nine and 39 marker be include in the rh map for ssc8 and ssc13 , contain five and 14 linkage group -lrb- lod4 -rrb- , respectively . a comparative approach enable we to identify tlr-related gene in region of conserve synteny among mammal that affect related trait in several species . however , the functional difference between mammal be relatively small and it can therefore be assume that the gene function establish in one mammalian species can in most case be extrapolate to the other . consequently , the tlr gene and they related signalling molecule which be located within these qtl should be consider as potential candidate for explain phenotypic variation in disease related trait and could therefore be exploit through genetic selection for desirable allele . to date only polymorphism in _ ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- igg fc fragment receptor transporter alpha chain -rrb- have be associate with relevant health trait . this approach be not always reliable , as gene function might change during evolution lead to limited difference among species -lrb- -rrb- . all new primer be design use primer3 -lrb- -rrb- with a target amplicon length of 300 bp . pathogen which use the same underlie mechanism of a pathogen-driven induction of ifn- transcription to reduce the host 's defence would probably also be affect by a similar polymorphism in _ ENSEMBLGENE _ . however , expression study in mouse show that three gene be differentially express in divergent mouse phenotype _ post _ infection with _ trypanosoma congolense _ -lrb- -rrb- which include _ myd88 _ , chemokine -lrb- c-x3-c motif -rrb- receptor 1 -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- , and chemokine binding protein 2 -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- and one _ post _ infection with _ yersinium enterocolitica _ -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- -lrb- -rrb- . another relevant gene , _ rfc1 _ -lrb- replication factor 1 -rrb- , have higher transcript level in bone marrow-derived macrophage -lrb- bmdm -rrb- isolate from disease susceptible balb/c mouse than from resistant c57bl/6 mouse _ post _ infection with _ yersinium enterocolitica _ . the ENSEMBLGENE bind igg , and serve to transfer igg to mucosal surface . in ruminant and pig it be likely to be particularly important in colostral immunoglobulin transfer to newborn as it be express in the newly lactating mammary gland . in human , polymorphism within gene code for tlr and associate signalling molecule be associate with a predisposition to several disease -lrb- -

ENSEMBLGENE _ in the variation cause by the QTL . a comparative analysis of the position of previously publish relevant qtl allow the identification of homologous region that be associate with similar health trait in several species and which contain tlr related and other immunologically relevant gene . in the pig , it be likely that the QTL affect _ escherichia _ -lrb- _ E. -rrb- coli _ resistance be cause by a polymorphism in the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- fucosyltransferase 1 -rrb- gene which be closely link to _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- -rrb- . the wide range of pathogen control by the qtl seem to suggest that different gene might be responsible for the qtl effect in the different species . the transcriptional regulation of type i interferon be coordinate , at least in part , by interferon

molecule that bind to pamp and consequently trigger a immune response -lrb- -rrb- , play a major role within the innate immune system . over the last decade , several study have identify quantitative trait locus -lrb- qtl -rrb- affect variation of immune related trait in mammal . myd88 , ENSEMBLGENE , irak-1 and ENSEMBLGENE be also involve in tlr-induced apoptosis mediate by caspase-8 -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- -lrb- review by Bannerman & Goldblum -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- . we investigate they functional relevance for the trait in question , review expression study and analyse further immune related gene locate in the region . with the increase availability of qtl and expression datum , this approach could be extend to identify additional gene of economic interest in livestock and also to provide new insight into complex phenotype in human . tlr bind they ligand in a horseshoe-shaped leucine rich repeat -lrb- lrr -rrb- domain , which enable a toll/interleukin -1 receptor -lrb- tir -rrb- domain to associate with adapter protein like the Toll/interleukin -1 receptor domain-containing adapter protein -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- , lymphocyte antigen 96 -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE or md2 -rrb- , or myeloid differentiation primary response protein -lrb- myd88 -rrb- which bind with the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 -lrb- irak-1 -rrb- . most mammalian species share ten tlr gene -lrb- _ tlr1-10 _ -rrb- , each detect pamp with different molecular structure . eighteen of the 20 _ tlr _ and associate signalling gene could be localised use comparative information between the porcine FPC map and the human whole genome sequence -lrb- -rrb- . SIA search literature and murine microarray database for evidence of tlr-related transcriptional response variation . the association with malaria suggest together with the differential expression in divergent mouse , sheep and cattle phenotype _ post _ infection with protozoan or other parasite -lrb- Table -rrb- , that the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ family cluster might also be involve in the recognition of further yet unknown ligand . tlr be find in all animal and even plant homologue have be describe -lrb- -rrb- , illustrate the ancient origin of this gene family . additional evidence be gather by examine relevant gene expression and association study . this binding activate the tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- , trigger a cascade which finally result in nuclear factor-kappa b -lrb- nf-b -rrb- liberation , activate the expression of pro-inflammatory gene -lrb- review by Werling & Jungi -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- . the result rh map be now publicly available at the arkdb database -lrb- -rrb- . kj search literature and bovine and ovine microarray database for evidence of tlr-related transcriptional response variation . a additional molecule , the toll-interacting protein -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- , be involve in the regulation of this process -lrb- -rrb- . in mouse , several differential gene expression study involve a multitude of trait have be conduct , result in large dataset which be publicly available -lrb- , -rrb- . oj design the primer , screen the ovine and porcine rh panel , calculate the pig rh map , build _ in-silico _ map , perform the comparative qtl overlap study and prepare the draft manuscript . however , to date no evidence for such polymorphism be available . two gene -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- could not be assign to a position in the porcine FPC map because a 3 mb human sequence fragment surround the localisation of the gene produce no significant alignment with any porcine clone map on the FPC map . gene transcript datum be retrieve from the corresponding database and analyse for differential expression by calculate the ratio of transcript level between population . the toll-like receptor adaptor molecule -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE or ENSEMBLGENE and ENSEMBLGENE or ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- have be show to activate ENSEMBLGENE and also to trigger interferon  or  -lrb- ifn- /  -rrb- response -lrb- , -rrb- . the ovine rh map be construct use the rh_tsp_map 3.0 software package -lrb- -rrb- and CONCORDE -lrb- -rrb- link with the qsopt package -lrb- -rrb- as describe -lrb- , -rrb- . however , to date no significant association of the chemokine receptor located in the homologous qtl with protozoan infection have be detect . ENSEMBLGENE and ENSEMBLGENE can also be activate by kinase which be regulate by myd88/traf6 -lrb- -rrb- . the pre-eminence of tlr and these associate signalling molecule in the initial recognition of pathogen suggest that they could be strong candidate for animal health trait . difference between Means be test by a two-tailed t-test use the corresponding Excel function . however , ENSEMBLGENE be not functional in mouse and must therefore be exclude as a common candidate for both species , although it remain a possible candidate gene for the mastitis related qtl in cattle . recent study in human and mouse suggest that part of this variation may be cause by polymorphism in gene involve in toll-like receptor -lrb- tlr -rrb- signalling . five of they -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE , 6 , 9 , myd88 _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- be functionally involve in immune response against the qtl associate pathogen -lrb- Table . the innate immune system be the first line of defence against invade pathogen and be activate by conserve pathogen associate molecular pattern -lrb- pamp -rrb- . hf build porcine _ in-silico _ map . the _ in-silico _ position for each locus be predict by a alignment of the human genome sequence surround the localisation of the tlr-related gene -lrb- -rrb- with the bac end sequence in the FPC map . position of tlr-related gene in the pig genome be predict use information of the porcine FPC map -lrb- -rrb- . of the 18 gene with predict location , six -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE , 2 , 6 , 10 _ on ssc8 and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ myd88 _ on ssc13 -rrb- be map on the porcine rh map use the Cambridge-Roslin rh panel -lrb- Table . _ myd88 _ be locate on this chromosome at 354.4 cr and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ at 588.8 cr . position of the tlr-related gene be predict in sheep by identify the gene sequence within the virtual sheep genome -lrb- -rrb- use the virtual sheep genome browser -lrb- -rrb- . the Roslin-Cambridge porcine rh panel -lrb- -rrb- be screen with six tlr-related gene , 20 other gene and 72 microsatellite marker , all predict to be on porcine chromosome 8 and 13 , base on comparative analysis of the pig fingerprint contig -lrb- fpc -rrb- map -lrb- -rrb- . the total map length be 2669.0 cr . comparison with the ENSEMBLGENE v2 map display a very consistent marker order -lrb- additional file : pig chromosome 13 -rrb- . four tlr gene be assign to this chromosome ; _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ 6 _ and _ 10 _ be closely link between 446.9 and 490.5 cr on ssc8a , whereas _ ENSEMBLGENE _ map at 310.5 cr on ssc8b -lrb- additional file : pig chromosome 8 -rrb- . the other gene could be screen for snp which could then be test for association with health related trait in livestock . due to they close linkage and they function or expression pattern some evidence suggest in addition _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ as further potential candidate gene . the result rh map show a very consistent marker order when compare to the ENSEMBLGENE v2 map -lrb- additional file : pig chromosome 8 -rrb- . the gene involve in tlr signalling be suggest to be candidate for health trait in mammalian species . fifty-nine marker -lrb- 23 gene and 36 microsatellite -rrb- be assign to five linkage group at lod4 on porcine chromosome 8 -lrb- ssc8 -rrb- , which themselves be order into two group correspond to both arm -lrb- ssc8a with 24 marker and ssc8b with 35 marker -rrb- of the chromosome use marker in common with the ENSEMBLGENE v2 porcine linkage map -lrb- -rrb- as the scaffold -lrb- additional file : pig chromosome 8 -rrb- . the most compelling evidence for involvement in pathogen susceptibility trait have be demonstrate for _ ENSEMBLGENE , ENSEMBLGENE , myd88 _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ . the length of ssc8a and b be 915.2 centiray -lrb- cr -rrb- and 1312.9 cr , respectively . we identify tlr-related gene which be located in homologous region that be associate with similar health related trait in several species and investigate they importance by functional comparison with other link immune related gene . however , this type of information be more limited for livestock species . in this project , we use a comparative approach to investigate the importance of tlr-related gene in comparison with other immunologically relevant gene for resistance trait in five species by associate they genomic location with previously publish immune-related qtl region . CONCORDE thirty-eight gene be list in the innatedb non-redundant gene list of immunologically relevant murine or human gene -lrb- -rrb- -lrb- additional file : immunologically relevant gene in region of conserve synteny surround the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ family cluster , _ myd88 _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- and six be consider as functionally relevant accord to they go annotation -lrb- Table . together they comprise approximately 10 mb , within which the parasite-related qtl in mouse and cattle overlap -lrb- figure . assume that homologous qtl be control by the same gene in several species , the QTL span be narrow down to the common block of conserve gene synteny among the species -lrb- figure , and . seventy-seven of they be list in the innatedb non-redundant gene list of immune-related murine or humane gene -lrb- -rrb- -lrb- additional file : immunologically relevant gene in region of conserve synteny surround the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ family cluster , _ myd88 _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- . SheepQTLdb _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be located in a region affect health trait in all five species , but the qtl control host response for a wide range of pathogen -lrb- Table . the homologous qtl overlap among mouse , human , cattle and sheep comprise two block of conserve gene synteny between these species and have a combined extent of approximately 7 mb -lrb- figure . _ myd88 _ be located in a qtl related to protozoan infection in cattle and mouse -lrb- Table . both qtl share a area which in cattle and mouse comprise 97 and 100 gene , respectively . the region contain in human , mouse and cattle 241 , 263 and 210 gene , respectively . eight gene be consider as functionally relevant accord to they gene ontology -lrb- go -rrb- annotation -lrb- Table . gene located within the homologous qtl overlap and list within the innatedb non-redundant gene list -lrb- -rrb- be consider as functionally relevant if they go annotation contain the keyword `` immune response '' , `` cellular defence '' , `` response to ... -lrb- any pathogen -rrb- '' or `` defence to ... -lrb- any pathogen -rrb- '' . particularly in mouse a multitude of health related qtl cover relatively large proportion of the chromosome so that the localisation of the gene within such a region provide rather limited evidence for a involvement into the mechanism shape the variation of the trait . the more the size of the inter-specific qtl region can be reduce , the greater become the support for the candidate gene within this region . the relationship of a gene to a phenotype can also be indicate by its functional relevance or by expression pattern which differ among phenotype . therefore a combination of approach be necessary and can provide much stronger evidence for or against the involvement of candidate gene in variation of disease resistance trait -lrb- Table . there be four region of conserve synteny between bovine chromosome 22 and murine chromosome 9 which be differentially order and orientate between both species . position of the analyse gene in the human -lrb- ncbus 36 -rrb- , mouse -lrb- ncbus m37 -rrb- and cattle -lrb- btau 4.0 -rrb- genome be retrieve from the ENSEMBL website -lrb- -rrb- by name string-search . marker limit the significant qtl boundary be identify in the relevant study -lrb- Table -rrb- and they position identify as describe before . further study be require to investigate the potential role of polymorphism within these gene . myd88 have be associate with a protective effect during infection with _ Trypanosoma _ -lrb- -rrb- and _ Toxoplasma _ -lrb- -rrb- strain . in addition association study have link polymorphic variant of human and murine ENSEMBLGENE , 6 and ENSEMBLGENE with susceptibility to relevant disease . thus , a hypothetical _ myd88 _ polymorphism affect the gene function could balance protection against different protozoan parasite . these four gene be located in qtl region which harbour further immunologically relevant gene . gene within homologous qtl overlap can be select base on they ontology . only significantly different transcript level -lrb- p < 0.05 -rrb- be consider further . interestingly , during malaria infection myd88 signalling be involve in a excessive cytokine production which be responsible for most of the clinical symptom -lrb- -rrb- . for example in mouse 12 tlr be know -lrb- -rrb- , but only 9 of the tlr1-10 which be common in most mammal be functional in mouse . functional relevance have often be deduce from other species . differential expression of _ tlr_s and related gene have be analyse in the gastrointestinal tract of sheep infect with _ haemonchus contortus _ and _ trichostronglyus colubriformi _ -lrb- -rrb- . four tlr-related gene -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ 6 _ , _ myd88 _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- appear to be the most likely candidate gene underlie qtl region which control the resistance to the same or similar pathogen in several species . hence we pursue a combined approach which can provide much stronger evidence . further evidence arise also for myd88 by differential expression in mouse strain of divergent resistance post infection with _ trypanosoma congolense _ which be of particular interest because of the ambiguous involvement of myd88 into the control of protozoan infection -lrb- -rrb- . gene located within the result homologous qtl overlap be retrieve from the ensembl database -lrb- -rrb- . genetic determinant of viral susceptibility porcine BES search however , homologous qtl region can be narrow by include comparative information from other species -lrb- , -rrb- . gene expression viewer six of the analyse gene be located in homologous qtl region which control the susceptibility to the same or a closely related pathogen in several species . the position for _ ENSEMBLGENE _ on ENSEMBLGENE and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ on ssc13 on the FPC map agree with another study -lrb- -rrb- . the three inconsistency between the virtual sheep genome and rh position in this study -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ irak-1 _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- be likely due to limited locus on the rh map result in non-significant linkage , which could be resolve in the near future by add additional marker to the rh map . all 20 tlr-related gene could be localised in the virtual sheep genome -lrb- , -rrb- . genomic coordinate of the tlr-related gene be compare with the location of health-related qtl in pig , sheep , cattle , human and mouse -lrb- Table , -lrb- - -rrb- -rrb- . however , to date , no study in pig have be undertake to investigate tlr gene expression difference in phenotypically divergent line . this comparative genomic approach identify eight gene as potentially causative gene for variation of health related trait . significant linkage be demonstrate for 16 of the 20 locus by lod score greater than 5 , allow a assignment of the locus to the ovine rh map and a comparison to the _ in-silico _ position predict by the virtual sheep genome -lrb- Table . thus , _ in-silico _ position be confirm by lab base mapping technique for seven of the 18 tlr-related gene -lrb- Table . thus , the confirmation of 17 of the 20 gene by rh mapping use the usuorh5000 panel -lrb- -rrb- suggest that the _ in-silico _ approach for predict gene position use the virtual sheep genome hold great promise . in contrast , myd88 be due to its central position as a adaptor molecule involve in the immune response to many different pathogen , include protozoan -lrb- review by Ropert _ et al. _ -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- . in cattle , expression difference have be investigate in breed of different susceptibility to _ theileria annulata _ -lrb- -rrb- and _ trypanosoma congolense _ -lrb- Kemp , personal communication -rrb- . the remain three gene be not position with confidence on the rh map so the position predict by the virtual sheep genome could not be confirm . study in pig have mostly address the role of specific tlr during host pathogen interaction and have be review recently -lrb- -rrb- . we also report medium-density rh map for porcine chromosome 8 and 13 . chromosomal mapping of host susceptibility locus to angiostrongylus costaricensis nematode infection in mouse in addition , a alignment of publicly available porcine mrna sequence of the gene against the current pre-assembled htg -lrb- high throughput genomic sequence -rrb- pig sequence database -lrb- -rrb- result in 14 alignment which all confirm the position predict by the FPC map -lrb- Table . in summary , the predict position of 17 gene on the virtual sheep genome be confirm -lrb- lod  5.0 -rrb- or support -lrb- lod = 2.49 -rrb- by rh mapping . three gene be tentatively assign on the rh map to location other than predict by the virtual sheep genome -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE and ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- or unlinked to any other marker -lrb- _ irak-1 _ -rrb- but all three have non-significant lod score -lrb- 2.97 , 3.7 , and 2.97 , respectively -rrb- , suggest that the location predict by the virtual sheep genome be more plausible than the rh location -lrb- Table . one of these four gene -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- be tentatively link to a marker on chromosome 21 -lrb- lod = 2.49 -rrb- , the same location predict by the virtual sheep genome . virtual sheep genome browser although gene involve in tlr signalling have be annotated in the mouse and human genome and successfully map in cattle -lrb- , -rrb- , only a subset of _ tlr_s and no tlr-associated signalling molecule have be localised in other livestock species . Radiation hybrid mapping of two member of the toll-like receptor gene family in pig here we report the genomic location of ten tlr gene -lrb- _ tlr1-10 _ -rrb- and a further ten associate signalling molecule in sheep , pig , cattle , human and mouse and compare they position with previously publish health related qtl . therefore , while the lod score for the rh mapping be not significant , the rh analysis support the _ in-silico _ position -lrb- Table . a radiation hybrid map of pig chromosome 4 only _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ have be map in the porcine genome -lrb- , -rrb- , while the location of the sheep _ tlr _ and associate gene be currently unknown . the remain four gene be link to marker on the ovine rh map but with lod score of  5.0 . gelscore cloning and radiation hybrid mapping of bovine toll-like receptor-4 -lrb- tlr-4 -rrb- signalling molecule strain-dependent migration of lymphocyte to the vaginal mucosa after peripheral immunization in order to confirm these _ in-silico _ position -lrb- Table -rrb- , primer for the 20 gene -lrb- additional file : primer use for rh mapping of tlr and signalling molecule -rrb- be use to screen the USU orh5000 ovine radiation hybrid panel -lrb- -rrb- to analyse linkage with previously assign marker on the ovine rh map . the qtl effect on the susceptibility to _ trypanosoma congolense _ infection in cattle -lrb- -rrb- and _ plasmodium chabaudus _ infection in mouse -lrb- -rrb- might be related , as both disease be the result of protozoan infection which presumably carry similar pamp and activate the same pathway .

Hyperekplexia be know to be genetic or sporadic with the genetic form be more frequent . the main pathologic impairment be the inability of glycine , which be one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system , to display its inhibitory effect , particularly in the brain stem -lrb- -rrb- . genetic study have show that most of the genetic case be autosomal dominant and that the responsible gene be find in the alpha-1 and beta subunit and glycine-carrying part of glycine receptor as well as in the protein of gephyrin and collybistin that both have glycine-like effect -lrb- -rrb- . DETECTEDPHENO be a frequent problem in the newborn . DETECTEDPHENO cause convulsion by increase glutamate , the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the brain -lrb- -rrb- . the most important clinical feature of hyperekplexium be extreme reaction to stimulus cause by genetic mutation or incomplete development of the inhibitory glycine receptor in the brain secondary to DETECTEDPHENO , tumor , inflammation , and dysgenesis -lrb- , , -rrb- . the baby boy be bear full-term by spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 28-year-old healthy female mother as a fifth pregnancy . respiratory ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- be require for the pathologic DETECTEDPHENO follow convulsion . the increase in glutamate due to DETECTEDPHENO plus the glycine defect cause hyperekplexium might have significantly increase cortical irritation and thus the hyperplexium , lead to a status epilepticus-like clinical presentation . serious DETECTEDPHENO can lead to optic and mental disorder , epilepsy , and brain damage . . although hyperekplexium be a rare nonepileptic phenomenon , it should be consider in case of convulsion resistant to therapy , in convulsion with no organic underlie disease or in persistent convulsion-like DETECTEDPHENO movement after treatment of the underlie disease . Hyperekplexia be a rare , nonepileptic , genetic , or sporadic neurologic disorder characterize by startle response to acoustic , optic , or tactile stimulus . unusual presentation of cerebral dysgenesis in a neonate glycine be one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system . with a correct diagnosis of hyperekplexium , unnecessary antiepileptic therapy and possible side effect can be avoid and appropriate treatment can diminish convulsion attack . a confusing coincidence : neonatal hypoglycemic seizure and hyperekplexium Hyperekplexia be primarily cause by a genetic defect in glycine receptor ; rarely it can also occur secondary to DETECTEDPHENO , tumor , inflammation , and dysgenesis . in the differential diagnosis of hyperekplexium ; paroxysmal extreme DETECTEDPHENO disorder , epilepsy , nonketotic DETECTEDPHENO , Crisponi syndrome , and neonatal tetanus should be consider . many study have interpret the absence of epileptic activity on eeg during repeat jerk as be indicative of he -lrb- , -rrb- . during the 4-month follow-up period , he do not display DETECTEDPHENO on the DETECTEDPHENO monitor and he do not have any convulsion , only minimum-level contraction . model hypoxia-induced DETECTEDPHENO and hypoxic DETECTEDPHENO in the neonatal period hyperekplexium -lrb- he -rrb- , first describe by Kirstein and Silfverskiold in 1958 , be a rare and nonepileptic clinical entity characterize by DETECTEDPHENO and generalize startle response to acoustic , optic , or tactile stimulus -lrb- -rrb- . Hyperekplexia be often confuse with epileptic DETECTEDPHENO . the main problem in hyperekplexium be the incomplete development of inhibitory mechanism or exaggerated stimulation of excitatory mediator . here we present a case with hypoglycemic convulsion coexist with hyperekplexium , cause diagnostic difficulty . where upon , he be discharge from the hospital with clonazepam treatment . genetic defect in glycine receptor as well as DETECTEDPHENO , tumor , inflammation , and disgenesis be among the etiologic cause of the disease . the clinical presentation of hyperekplexium differ with the age of the patient , and this situation lead to difficulty in diagnosis . particularly in the newborn , the diagnosis be quite difficult because of the many manipulation in the intensive care unit , increase susceptibility to stimulus , and metabolic problem -lrb- DETECTEDPHENO , DETECTEDPHENO -rrb- . DETECTEDPHENO difficulty , life-threatening pathologic DETECTEDPHENO , sudden infant death , complete DETECTEDPHENO branch block , and cerebral anoxium can occur in serious hyperekplexium -lrb- -rrb- . it have be report that in seriously affected infant , severe jerk-like spasm can be confuse with epileptic attack and even with DETECTEDPHENO epilepticus . it be observe that the patient be extremely alert to acoustic and tactile stimulus and that these stimulus trigger the convulsion . due to the persistence of the convulsion , midazolam infusion be give . at birth , he weight be 2850 gram -lrb- 10 -- 50 percentile -rrb- , height be 50 cm -lrb- 50 percentile -rrb- , and he head circumference be 34 cm -lrb- 50 percentile -rrb- . in we case , the diagnosis of hyperekplexium be consider because convulsion continue in spite of correct DETECTEDPHENO , the eeg finding be normal and jerk diminish significantly with clonazepam treatment . on the postnatal second day , tonic and abnormal jerk-like DETECTEDPHENO involve all the extremity be observe . the patient be diagnose with hypoglycemic convulsion and give phenobarbital , after which he be send to we clinic and hospitalize . there be no history of a consanguineous marriage between the parent or the presence of a similar disease in the other child of the family or other family member . upon observe that the nasal pillow mask trigger DETECTEDPHENO , the diagnosis of hyperekplexium be consider and treatment with clonazepam be start . the patient initially have subtle DETECTEDPHENO like pedal , lick lip , and swallow which be then follow by generalize tonic convulsion . the blood glucose be measure at 32 mg/dl during these DETECTEDPHENO . the patient first receive 4 cc/kg intravenous 10 % dextrose solution . the midazolam , phenobarbital , and levetiracetam that he have be take be gradually reduce in dose and stop . consider the effect that minimal stimulus have , ENSEMBLGENE be replace by a oxygen hood for ventilation and stimulate intervention be minimalize . the patient then display a significant decrease in the intensity and number of he DETECTEDPHENO , start normal breast feeding , have normal blood glucose level , and have no DETECTEDPHENO . he blood glucose be 32 mg/dl . upon prolonged DETECTEDPHENO and deterioration of he general condition both enteral and parenteral nutrition be start . convulsion continue despite the normalization of the blood sugar level and the multiple antiepileptic drug . in he physical examination , there be no dysmorphic appearance and the other system be find to be normal . the urine and blood amino acid , the urine sulphite test , and the serum uric acid be all within normal range . hormone test , carry out to explain he resistant DETECTEDPHENO , yield normal result . in the repeat eeg , there be no electroencephalographic abnormality accompany the DETECTEDPHENO trigger by stimulus and no other finding except for movement artefact . in the meantime , he cranial magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- MRI -rrb- and electroencephalogram -lrb- eeg -rrb- result be normal . then , a important observation be make . in spite of the maximum dose of midazolam infusion and vitamin b6 supplement , the convulsion continue and levetiracetam be add to the treatment regimen . immediately after birth , the infant cry but display no change in skin color , and he Apgar score be 7 and 9 at one and 5 minute , respectively .

Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA -rrb- . therefore , we perform a mutational analysis of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene in chinese family with ENSEMBLGENE . the characterization of such mutation will help to elucidate the important functional domain of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ . the dna sequence abnormality of the wisp3 gene be initially detect in each of the four ppd patient by the use of five pcr primer pair -lrb- -rrb- that be specific for code exon 2 to 6 and exon-intron boundary . leukocytic dna be prepare use a QIAGEN dna minus kit -lrb- Qiagen , Hilden , Germany -rrb- . the x-ray image display mainly DETECTEDPHENO with irregularly shaped vertebra , DETECTEDPHENO epiphys and metaphys of the long bone , narrow joint space and DETECTEDPHENO . the extensive biological function of wisp3 -lrb- ccn6 -rrb- , especially in skeletal development and cell survival and apoptosis , be of great academic interest . the fact that _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mutation be link to ENSEMBLGENE have confirm the protein 's essential role in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis . this family of protein , which be most likely involve in the control of cell differentiation and proliferation , participate in angiogenesis , chondrogenesis , and osteogenesis . the knee , elbow and hip be all affect at the age of 12 . at the age of 5 , swell and then stiffness of the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joint emerge . the patient in this manuscript give write inform consent to publish they case detail . four affected individual with ppd be enrol and designate as patient ii 1 and ii 2 in family 1 , and ii 1 and ii 2 in family 2 . we result , take in the context of prior study of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene analysis , confirm the notion that _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mutation variability be responsible for ENSEMBLGENE and extend the spectrum of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene defect that cause ENSEMBLGENE . these brother be bear from non-consanguineous parent . Liao et al. have predict that the c-terminal peptide be located in the opposite direction in the ser334pro mutant ENSEMBLGENE protein with another c. 840delt in the compound heterozygous mutation , which change the 3d-conformational structure of the mutant protein , and therefore conclude that the coexistence of a c. 1000t > c substitution be necessary for the clinical onset of ENSEMBLGENE . in conclusion , we study of chinese family with ENSEMBLGENE report the detection of two novel and two recurrent _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mutation , which have not be identify in any other ethnic group . all clinical investigation be conduct accord to the principle express in the declaration of Helsinki . Family 1 consist of 2 brother who be affect with ENSEMBLGENE with different degree of severity . a comprehensive understanding of the disease should be improve , and genetic diagnosis for this type of disease be imperative . the study protocol be approve by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital . however , the role of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ in chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation and the mechanism by which these mutation cause ENSEMBLGENE have not be establish . in contrast with previously report case , DETECTEDPHENO be not clearly observe in these two family , exclude the hip DETECTEDPHENO observe in the advanced stage of the disease . write informed consent form be obtain from the patient , they parent and healthy control . no association between the order of the mutation from 5  to 3  along the gene and a decrease in clinical severity be apparent ; 2 . we could hardly conclude that non-sense or frameshift mutation be generally more severe than missense mutation . however , we work raise several notable point as follow : 1 . PPD patient symptom be more severe with advance age ; and 3 . in we study , all four patient experience almost the same clinical course as follow -lrb- -rrb- : onset at the age of 4 or 5 , progressive DETECTEDPHENO swell -lrb- e.g. , in hand , elbow , hip , knee and ankle -rrb- , a DETECTEDPHENO stature and a mode of inheritance consistent with autosomal recessive transmission . a normal life expectancy be estimate , whereas DETECTEDPHENO contracture , fracture and DETECTEDPHENO stenosis be major prognostic factor in ENSEMBLGENE . notably , the present case have a similar phenotypic expression and a different degree of severity within the same family . the older brother exhibit a more severe phenotype with a more serious involvement of height DETECTEDPHENO retardation and multiple DETECTEDPHENO swell and stiffness , whereas he younger brother present with a height that be slightly below the normal range and no early symptom of degenerative osteoarthrosis . the radiographic characteristic that distinguish ENSEMBLGENE from other DETECTEDPHENO include widen epiphys and vertebral flattening . ser334pro -rrb- and a frameshift mutation -lrb- c. 866_867ins a/p .

Spearman 's rho be use to evaluate the correlation between continuous variable . in the event of disagreement between duplicate sample , the analysis be repeat . for this purpose commercially available fluorescent-labeled reagent be acquire and apply accord to the guideline of the manufacturer -lrb- Life Technologies Corporation -rrb- . the lower expression of _ ces1p1 _ and thus larger variation between the duplicate allow for fewer duplicate to pass the criterion of a CV % < 1 % . calculation of the gene copy number be accomplish use CopyCaller v 1.0 , a program develop by the manufacturer of the assay reagent . all statistical test be perform use ENSEMBLGENE -lrb- version 9.2 , ENSEMBLGENE Institute , Cary , NC -rrb- . these reagent target a region in exon 11 of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- assay identification hs00139541_cn -rrb- . the gene encode the ribonuclease p rna component serve as reference gene . _ p < _ 0.05 be consider significant . we use the standard curve method for quantification of mrna by TaqMan  - base pcr on a ABI Prism 7900 HT system from Applied Biosystems , now Life Technologies Corporation -lrb- Carlsbad , CA -rrb- . use reagent also purchase from this company , we determine the mrna level of _ ces1 _ in 206 individual -lrb- assay identification hs00275607_m1 -rrb- , while that of _ ces1p1 _ only be determine in 159 individual due to technical issue -lrb- assay identification hs00750233_s1 -rrb- . dna be purify from leukocyte employ Autopure l  accord to the manufacturer 's recommendation -lrb- Qiagen GmbH , Hilden , Germany -rrb- . _ ces1 copy number variation . _ since the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna expression level in adipose tissue be find to be highly heritable and significantly associate with numerous measure of metabolic function , we evaluate the effect of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ duplication , a genetic variation that previously have be suggest to affect the transcript abundance of this gene . datum be present as mean  sd . the heritability coefficient for the mrna expression of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ ces1p1 _ amount to  1 and 0.84 , respectively . after adjustment for age , sex and bmus the level of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna be 27 % higher in the combined group compare with the NGT group . among the subject in the study population , 6 carry the duplicated allele on both chromosome , 60 be heterozygote for this allele , and 138 do not carry the duplicated allele . the genotype proportion conform to those expect under the condition of hardy-weinberg equilibrium -lrb- _ p _ = 0.86 -rrb- . _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level be also positively associate with other measure of metabolic function -lrb- -rrb- , include cholesterol -lrb- _ p _ = 0.04 -rrb- , and fast plasma level of insulin -lrb- _ p _ = 0.006 -rrb- , glucose -lrb- _ p _ = 0.002 -rrb- and triglyceride -lrb- _ p _ = 0.003 , see also . base on this observation , the frequency of the duplicated _ ENSEMBLGENE _ allele be estimate at 0.18 . conversely , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level be negatively associate with isicomposite -lrb- _ p _ = 0.005 -rrb- . alternatively , imbalance in the metabolism of cholesterol or other lipid due to intake of a diet rich in animal fat may lead to a altered blood lipid profile , and increment in body fat deposit that might affect the expression of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna . Adiposity be associate with a 10 % increase in _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level per BMI unit -lrb- and . _ tissue biopsy . one such study show that the hydrolysis of triglyceride in adipose tissue be severely decrease in mouse with global inactivation of ces3 , recently annotated as ces1d1 , which be the murine ortholog of human ENSEMBLGENE . one year of aging be associate with a decrease in the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level of 4 % , and the expression level in male be 35 % lower than in female . a heritability coefficient approach 0 indicate very limited genetic influence , whereas a heritability coefficient close to 1 indicate that the trait be under strong genetic control . in addition to gene duplication , variation in the promoter region of a gene can affect the amount of transcript produce . the clinical characteristic of this population have be describe in detail previously . ces1 _ mrna expression level in adipose tissue be significantly affect by age , gender , and bmus -lrb- _ p _ < 0.001 for all variable , . total rna be extract use TRI reagent -lrb- Sigma-Aldrich , St. Louis , MO -rrb- as describe previously . the heritability coefficient , often abbreviate as h2 , express the proportion of the total variation of a trait attributable to genetic variation . finally , there be a positive correlation between the level of mrna of _ ces1 _ and _ ces1p1 _ . since _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level be express in arbitrary unit , the association of this variable with other be calculate per double from its average . specimen be quickly blot onto filter paper and freeze in liquid nitrogen . it be determine as twice the difference of the intra-class correlation coefficient of mz and dz twin -lrb- h2 = 2 -lrb- rmz  rdz -rrb- -rrb- . genetic variation in carboxylesterase gene and susceptibility to isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity fast blood sample be analyze for serum triglyceride and total cholesterol level use commercial kit from Boerhinger Mannheim -lrb- Mannheim , Germany -rrb- . Weight and height as well as waist and hip circumference be measure , and BMI be calculate . DETECTEDPHENO resistance be assess use homa-ir : -lrb- fast plasma insulin * fast plasma glucose/22 .5 -rrb- * 0.144 . if ENSEMBLGENE have a role in the metabolic regulation in the liver that be comparable to its murine ortholog , this would explain we finding that _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene copy number be associate with DETECTEDPHENO resistance in the fasting state -lrb- homa-ir -rrb- , which be think to be primarily hepatically determine . this be do under local anesthesia -lrb- lidocaine -rrb- use a Bergstrm needle with suction apply . the positive association between _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene copy number and isicomposite suggest that variation in this gene impact on the peripheral insulin sensitivity , possibly affect glucose metabolism or insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle . this knowledge may be valuable for future research aim at understand the genetic architecture predispose for DETECTEDPHENO . in conclusion , the present study link the expression level of _ ces1 _ mrna with risk factor for DETECTEDPHENO and suggest that copy number variation of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ influence measure of glucose metabolism , perhaps contribute to the genetic susceptibility to DETECTEDPHENO . individual with DETECTEDPHENO and DETECTEDPHENO be combine into one group with impaired glucose regulation . _ Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy be take from the abdomen in a subgroup of the study population -lrb- _ n _ = 226 -rrb- . the study with its consent procedure be approve by the committee on Biomedical Research Ethics for the Capitol Region in Denmark and conduct in adherence with the guideline of the Helsinki Declaration . finally , besides the association with isicomposite , _ ces1 _ copy number be associate with glucose tolerance , a positive association that might reflect a effect on beta cell function and insulin secretion . moreover , liver specific inactivation of ces1d1 in mouse have be show to be associate with significantly decrease level of very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride and - cholesterol in plasma and moderately DETECTEDPHENO liver triglyceride level suggest a important role of hepatic ces1d1 in the lipid metabolism . the composite whole-body insulin sensitivity index -lrb- isus -rrb- composite be determine as follow : 10,000 / sqrt -lrb- -lrb- fast glucose * fast insulin -rrb- * -lrb- mean glucoseogtt * mean insulinogtt -rrb- -rrb- . various aspect of the role of ENSEMBLGENE in lipid metabolism remain to be clarify include the importance of ces1-mediated lipolysis in adipose tissue relative to that in the liver . a recent study raise doubt about the importance of ENSEMBLGENE in the hydrolysis of triglyceride in adipose tissue and suggest that other lipase be more important in this respect , while another study report a major role of ENSEMBLGENE in the trafficking of lipid and lipid metabolism in hepatocyte . so far , the expression of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna in DETECTEDPHENO have not be examine . the signed form be keep by the principal investigator for documentation purpose . the glucose tolerance status be define accord to the who 1999 criterion and range from normal glucose tolerance -lrb- ngt , _ n _ = 169 -rrb- over DETECTEDPHENO glucose tolerance -lrb- DETECTEDPHENO , _ n _ = 78 -rrb- to overt DETECTEDPHENO -lrb- _ n _ = 48 -rrb- . since pseudogene can affect the mrna level of they protein-coding counterpart , another inherit factor that could potentially modulate the level of mrna of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be carboxylesterase 1 pseudogene 1 -lrb- _ ces1p1 _ -rrb- , located in the vicinity of _ ces1 _ . whether ENSEMBLGENE be more important to the triglyceride metabolism in the liver than adipose tissue of human be not yet know . however , these effect remain to be confirm . a total of 295 monozygotic -lrb- mz -rrb- -lrb- _ n _ = 125 ; 48 complete pair and 29 single twin -rrb- and same-sex dizygotic -lrb- dz -rrb- -lrb- _ n _ = 170 ; 55 complete pair and 60 single twin -rrb- elderly danish twin subject -lrb- 62 -- 83 year -rrb- be recruit as previously describe . in contrast , finding of a relationship between _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level and other measure of metabolic function such as body-mass index -lrb- bmus -rrb- and total cholesterol level be inconsistent , possibly reflect limited statistical power , and inclusion of study participant with malignant disease . glucose tolerance status be determine employ a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test -lrb- ogtt -rrb- . disturbance of this balance may lead to DETECTEDPHENO resistance , DETECTEDPHENO plasma level of triglyceride , and DETECTEDPHENO , i.e. component of the metabolic syndrome . twenty-two subject have know DETECTEDPHENO and be treat with diet or glucose-lowering medication . therefore , the relative contribution of genetic and non-genetic variation to the expression of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna in subcutaneous adipose tissue remain unknown . a inform consent form be sign by all subject prior to they inclusion in the study . doubling of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level be within 2 sd , which be consider to be biologically plausible . a single nucleotide polymorphism in the carboxylesterase gene be associate with the responsiveness to imidapril medication and the promoter activity due to the small number of subject have 4 gene copy of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , we amalgamate the group with 3 and 4 copy of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ . this enzyme use a hydrolysis mechanism with release of the alcohol substituent from the substrate and formation of a fatty acyl-enzyme intermediate as the first step follow by a second step consist of reaction of the intermediate with water and release of the acyl group-containing molecule . this include carboxylesterase 1 -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- that seem to play a important role in the hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester and triglyceride . one such variation be duplication of the gene that may result in increase production of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna and thus increase ENSEMBLGENE activity albeit the `` daughter '' copy of the gene have be report to be transcribe at a lower level than the `` mother '' copy . hence , the enzyme appear to be involve in the de-esterification as well as transesterification of lipid . in the present study we examine a unique study population of phenotypically well-characterized elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twin subject -lrb- _ n _ = 295 individual -rrb- with the aim of provide new information about basal mechanism underlie t2dm by : 1 -rrb- assessment of the relationship of _ ces1 _ mrna expression level in subcutaneous adipose tissue with age , gender , measure of glucose and lipid metabolism , and _ ces1p1 _ mrna expression level ; 2 -rrb- determination of the heritability of _ ces1 _ mrna expression in adipose tissue ; 3 -rrb- assessment of the relationship of _ ces1 _ copy number with _ ces1 _ mrna expression in adipose tissue and measure of metabolic function in healthy and t2dm subject . in this regard , the lack of association between _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene copy number variation and mrna level in adipose tissue be surprising , when this genetic variation be propose to have effect on glucose and lipid metabolism . carboxylesterase 1 -lrb- ces1 -rrb- appear to play a important role in the control of the metabolism of triglyceride and cholesterol in adipocyte and other cell type include hepatocyte . adipose tissue be the major site for storage of cholesterol and triglyceride in the body , the hydrolysis and esterification of lipid in this tissue be closely regulate to maintain a tight balance between lipid release , storage , and trafficking . several enzyme be implicate in the lipid metabolism in human adipose tissue . one explanation for this apparent discrepancy may be that the duplicated version of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be in linkage disequilibrium with a gene variant that affect glucose metabolism indirectly or directly without increase the expression of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna . _ ces1 and ces1p1 mrna expression . therefore , ENSEMBLGENE activity may not be correlate with level of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna and copy number status of _ ces1 _ . therefore , it be relevant to gain insight into the genetic versus non-genetic mechanism involve in the control of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna expression . regulation of the activity of ces1 may , however , be even more complex as it also seem to include regulatory control on the protein level by endogenous small molecule , such as cholesterol-like molecule . twin study and they implication for molecular genetic study : endophenotype integrate quantitative and molecular genetics in ADHD research notably , antisense transcript generate from these genetic element have be implicate in the translational silencing of they functional homolog . the heritability for the expression of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna in adipose tissue be high . a role of carboxylesterase in the lipid metabolism in human be support by observation from animal model . this be a interesting possibility since the haplotype harbor the duplicated allele lack _ ces1p1 _ , while this pseudogene be present on the haplotype with the unduplicated allele . yet , this heritability have not be determine . here , we investigate _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna expression level in adipose tissue and its association with measure of adiposity and metabolic function in a population of elderly twin . _ ces1 _ mrna expression level in adipose tissue be positively associate with body-mass index -lrb- _ p _ < 0.001 -rrb- , homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance -lrb- _ p _ = 0.003 -rrb- and level of fast glucose -lrb- _ p _ = 0.002 -rrb- , insulin -lrb- _ p _ = 0.006 -rrb- , and triglyceride -lrb- _ p _ = 0.003 -rrb- . caloric homeostasis and disorder of fuel transport since ENSEMBLGENE may play a important role in the mechanism lead to dysregulation of lipid and glucose metabolism and eventually to DETECTEDPHENO , , the heritability of the expression level of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna in adipose tissue be of scientific interest . because ENSEMBLGENE have a potentially significant role in the lipid homeostasis , and its activity have be suggest to be primarily regulate on the transcriptional level , the amount of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna in adipose tissue may serve as a intermediate phenotype provide important information about the mechanism lead to DETECTEDPHENO 2 diabetes mellitus -lrb- DETECTEDPHENO -rrb- . they be subject to a standard oral glucose tolerance test and excision of abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsy during the fasting state . level of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna and copy number of the gene be assess by quantitative pcr . a variety of genetic variation may influence _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna expression . further study be need to understand the potential effect of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene duplication on adipocyte and whole-body metabolic function . a alternative possibility be that ENSEMBLGENE activity in adipose tissue be predominantly regulate by posttranscriptional mechanism include pseudogene-mediated transcript protection , a mechanism that appear to play a role in the regulation of several other gene . a dysregulation in ces1 , apoe and other lipid metabolism-related gene be associate to cardiovascular risk factor link to DETECTEDPHENO however , it have be suggest that the expression of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna in human adipose tissue be correlate with measure of adiposity and metabolic function include waist circumference , homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance -lrb- homa-ir -rrb- , triglyceride level , and plasma insulin level . a total of 295 monozygotic and dizygotic twin subject -lrb- 62 -- 83 year -rrb- with -lrb- _ n _ = 48 -rrb- or without -lrb- _ n _ = 247 -rrb- DETECTEDPHENO 2 diabetes mellitus be enrol in the study . although _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level be not significantly associate with 120-min ogtt glucose level -lrb- -rrb- , we find a borderline significant association -lrb- _ p _ = 0.057 -rrb- between the level of ogtt glucose and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna after adjustment for age , sex and bmus . apparently , the transcription in adipose tissue by genotype with 3 or 4 copy of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be comparable with that of genotype compose of 2 copy of the gene . human carboxylesterase 1a2 express from carboxylesterase 1a1 and 1a2 gene be a potent predictor of cpt-11 cytotoxicity in vitro there be several promoter variant in _ ENSEMBLGENE _ with a presumed effect on the transcription of this gene . however , even with this limitation the present study suggest the existence of a strong heritable component in the expression of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna in adipose tissue . use this approach we find decrease of 5 % and 14 % in the fasting level of glucose -lrb- _ p _ = 0.06 -rrb- and insulin -lrb- _ p _ = 0.04 -rrb- , respectively , in the group of subject with 3 or 4 _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene copy , while there be a 9 % increase in isicomposite -lrb- _ p _ = 0.05 -rrb- in this group compare with individual harbor 2 copy of the gene . this be in agreement with finding obtain by analysis of human liver , while the expression of _ ces1a2 _ have be find to be high in several cell line . furthermore , the heritability of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna expression level in adipose tissue and the effect of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene duplication be assess . moreover , we find a 19 % decrease in of homa-ir -lrb- _ p _ = 0.02 -rrb- and a 11 % decrease in ogtt -lrb- _ p _ = 0.03 -rrb- in the group of subject with 3 or 4 _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene copy . we result , suggest that copy number variation of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ could be involve in mediate such effect . although slightly lower , the observe frequency of this allele in the present study , base upon related as well as unrelated subject , be in accordance with this value . first , we find significant relationship between _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level and age , gender , measure of adiposity , metabolic regulation and _ ces1p1 _ mrna level . probably , this reflect that the `` daughter '' copy , often designate _ ces1a2 _ , be transcribe at a low level and therefore do not contribute substantially to the total amount of _ ces1 _ transcript . a genetic variation potentially confer individual difference in the expression of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be duplication of the gene . _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene duplication be positively associate with insulin sensitivity -lrb- _ p _ = 0.05 -rrb- as well as glucose tolerance -lrb- _ p _ = 0.03 -rrb- and negatively associate with homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance -lrb- _ p _ = 0.02 -rrb- . the copy number of the gene encode ENSEMBLGENE , include `` mother '' as well as `` daughter '' copy , be associate with several measure of glucose metabolism . therefore , the latter of these two haplotype have a potential for generation of _ ces1p1 _ transcript . pseudogene may act through different mechanism . however , use mouse with global knock-out of ces1d1 , the murine ortholog of the human ENSEMBLGENE , a recent study attribute most of the reduction in plasma triglyceride result from this gene knock-out to the absence of hepatic activity of ces1d1 . it be possible that pseudogen-mediated posttranscriptional regulation be involve in determine ENSEMBLGENE activity and that this explain some of the finding from the present study . hence , the individual difference in the expression level of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna observe in the present study may to large extent reflect variation within this gene or in gene in its vicinity . although it be know that insulin sensitivity be under strong genetic control , , very few genetic variation affect insulin sensitivity in the liver or skeletal muscle have be identify so far . second , a high heritability for the level of mrna expression of _ ces1 _ be detect . whether such mechanism be involve in the regulation of ENSEMBLGENE activity be not know . there be several plausible explanation for the observe association between the level of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna in subcutaneous adipose tissue and measure of glucose metabolism . more specifically , presence of 2 copy of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ appear to predispose to a negative phenotype and influence the susceptibility to DETECTEDPHENO suggest that the present study identify a novel genetic factor affect the risk of develop this disorder . structure and characterization of human carboxylesterase 1a1 , 1a2 , and 1a3 gene carboxylesterase 1 gene duplication and mrna expression in adipose tissue be link to DETECTEDPHENO and metabolic function duplication of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be not link to mrna level of this gene -lrb- _ p _ = 0.63 -rrb- . ENSEMBLGENE mrna in adipose tissue appear to be under strong genetic control and be associate with measure of metabolic function raise the possibility of a potential role of this enzyme in the development of DETECTEDPHENO 2 diabetes mellitus . of importance , a pseudogene have previously be associate with DETECTEDPHENO resistance and t2d by another posttransciptional regulation mechanism that involve destabilization of the transcript generate from a functional homolog . a strong heritable component in the transcription be characteristic of gene whose transcriptional level be determine by local regulatory variation . previously , the frequency of the duplicated allele of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be determine at 0.20 among voluntary blood donor in Denmark -lrb- Rasmussen et al. , unpublished result -rrb- . in the present study , the heritability of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue be high , exceed the average heritability of 0.234 for the mrna expression across gene in subcutaneous adipose tissue previously obtain by analysis of a family cohort . heritability coefficient have several limitation . Third , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene copy number be find to be associate with measure of glucose metabolism . for example , they can be inflate by shared pre - as well as post-natal environment . we finding of a positive correlation between the expression level of mrna of _ ces1p1 _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be interesting and since pseudogene can affect the level of mrna of they protein-coding counterpart , , , it suggest a novel mechanism for regulation of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna expression in adipose tissue . there be no significant association between the gene copy number and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna expression -lrb- _ p _ = 0.63 -rrb- . however , since the age span in the present study be only 21 year with the youngest subject be 62 year old , it can not be exclude that age affect _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level in adipose tissue differently in younger individual . the finding that individual with dysregulate glucose metabolism , include those with DETECTEDPHENO , display higher level of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna underscore the association of _ ces1 _ with glucose metabolism . base upon a large sample we finding support the latter of these two study . the strong correlation of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level with bmus , total cholesterol , and fast plasma glucose and insulin level observe in the present study be remarkable and may clarify disagree finding observe in previous study . for example , one study report lack of association of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level with bmus , while another study find a strong positive correlation between these two variable . notably , increase ces1-mediated lipolysis in adipose tissue could cause disturbance of the glucose metabolism by elevation of the plasma level of non-esterified fatty acid that can induce muscle and hepatic DETECTEDPHENO resistance , also , cholesterol imbalance in adipocyte seem capable of induce DETECTEDPHENO resistance and since ENSEMBLGENE be believe to have a important role in regulate the ratio of esterify and non-esterified cholesterol , such regulate role of ENSEMBLGENE could be reflect in the appearance of a association between level of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna and cholesterol . previous observation have suggest that the transcript of a pseudogene and its functional counterpart can compete for the same transact factor involve in mrna degradation . furthermore , _ ces1 _ copy number be not associate with measure of adiposity or plasma lipid parameter , include plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol level . however , a larger effect of _ ces1 _ copy number be observe on homa-ir -lrb- _ p _ = 0.002 -rrb- and level of fast insulin -lrb- _ p _ = 0.002 -rrb- without the amalgamation . statistical analysis without amalgamation of the group with 3 and 4 _ ENSEMBLGENE _ copy produce result that be comparable to those obtain with amalgamation . we study be the first to report that _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna level in subcutaneous adipose tissue be negatively correlate with age in a population of elderly subject , and that _ ces1 _ be transcribe at significantly higher level in woman than man . therefore , high level of transcript generate from a pseudogene may efficiently protect the transcript of a functional homolog from degradation , thus increase its translation . although a previous small-sized study also find _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna expression level in visceral adipose tissue to be inversely associate with age , the association for subcutaneous adipose tissue in this study do not reach statistical significance . we report several important finding about the regulation and possible role of ENSEMBLGENE in the lipid and glucose homeostasis . in the present study the mrna expression level of _ ces1 _ in subcutaneous adipose tissue sample derive from monozygotic and dizygotic twin be examine . collectively , these finding suggest that ENSEMBLGENE be involve in the pathogenesis of DETECTEDPHENO . this suggest that genetic effect exhibit a quantitatively predominant influence on the variation of the mrna expression of these two gene in adipose tissue .

ENSEMBLGENE reaction be set up as follow : 5 l of adapt cdna , 0.2 m 10  UPM primer , 0.2 m gene-specific primer , 5 l of 10  reaction buffer , 0.2 mm dntp , 1 l of BD Advantage 2 polymerase mix , in a final volume of 50 l . for 3  - ENSEMBLGENE , seven specific primer flg2-f1  7 -lrb- -rrb- be design against the nucleotide sequence of the putative exon 2 and 3 of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene and use as sense primer , among which each flg2-f2  7 be use for the second round pcr whereas flg2-f1 be use for the first round pcr . the absence of a clear full-length ENSEMBLGENE band in the sc extract suggest that ENSEMBLGENE be process within the stratum granulosum . amplicon be analyse by 2.0 % agarose gel electrophoresis and , where necessary , purify and sequence to confirm they identity . the thermal cycling condition be as follow : firstly with 5 cycle at 95  c for 20 s , 68  c for 30 s ; secondly 5 cycle at 95  c for 20 s , 66  c for 30 s ; then 30 cycle at 95  c for 20 s , 63  c for 30 s , 68  c for 30 s . the 3  - extend sequence be determine by 3  ENSEMBLGENE , which include a polyadenylation signal site -lrb- aauaaa -rrb- situate eleven nucleotide from its 3  extremity . mapping of this 5  - extend sequence determine the first exon -lrb- 51 bp -rrb- , the second exon -lrb- 160 bp -rrb- and a part of the third exon . furthermore , both repeat domain of ENSEMBLGENE contain a high proportion of histidine and glutamine residue , the source of the natural moisturizing factor urocanic acid and pyrrolidone carboxylic acid , suggest ENSEMBLGENE may contribute to maintain sc hydration as propose for filaggrin . one pair of gene-specific primer flg2-rtf and flg2-rtr -lrb- -rrb- be design to overlap intron 2 of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene and amplify the 198-bp cdna target . the reaction mixture be dilute 10-fold with h2o for further pcr experiment . qualitative rt-pcr assay be perform with advantage 2 polymerase Mix -lrb- BD Bioscience Clontech , Heidelberg , Germany -rrb- . to design primer pair to uniquely amplify the ENSEMBLGENE gene , all the 5  - end 500-bp nucleotide sequence of the sftp gene family be retrieve from genbank and then use for primer design by the Primo unique program . in contrast to the propose classification of the ENSEMBLGENE repeat , we suggest that ENSEMBLGENE can generate two kind of repeat unit with homology to filaggrin and hornerin , respectively . quantitative real-time rt-pcr assay be carry out with the same primer pair as above use the SYBR  Premix ex taq  kit -lrb- Takara Bio , Heidelberg , Germany -rrb- in a fluorescence thermocycler follow the instruction of the manufacturer -lrb- LightCycler , Roche molecular biochemical , Hamburg , Germany -rrb- . Cycling condition be : 45 cycle at 95  c for 10 s , then 69  c for 20 s -lrb- ` touchdown ' of  1  c/cycle to 63  c -rrb- . fluorescence measurement be take at 72  c at the end of each cycle . the pcr product be separate on a 2.0 % agarose gel and then visualize by ethidium bromide staining . as a internal control of cdna template , the housekeeping gene _ glyceraldehyde phosphodehydrogenase _ -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- be assess with each cdna in a separate pcr reaction by one pair of intron-spanning primer -lrb- forward primer : 5  - CCA GCC gag CCA ENSEMBLGENE CGC tc-3  , reverse primer : 5  - atg agc ccc agc CTT CTC ENSEMBLGENE  -rrb- . in we study , we have develop two specific primer pair that can uniquely amplify the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene with the primer unique program . the specificity of the pcr product be confirm by sequencing . indeed , in consideration of high sequence similarity between each other among the 5  - end region of all the sftp gene member , it seem that the design of specific primer emerge as a key barrier to successfully distinguish various sftp member . there be nine a-type internal repeat , which display high identity to hornerin , and fourteen b-type internal repeat , which resemble those of filaggrin . for standard curve acquisition , eight serial 10-fold dilution of linearize plasmid dna contain the insert be prepare for each primer set , represent 30 to 3.0  108 double-stranded dna molecule quantify by use of a BioPhotometer -lrb- Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany -rrb- . while support keratinocyte expression of _ flg2 _ as the major cellular source , we datum be inconsistent with they conclusion that _ ENSEMBLGENE _ expression be restricted to the epidermis . for calculation of the relative transcript amplification , the housekeeping gene _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be perform with each cdna in a separate pcr reaction by the same pair of primer as above . we datum show that in addition to skin , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna be also present in thymus , stomach , tonsil , testis and placenta . Cycling condition be as follow : with 45 cycle at 95  c for 10 s , 69  c for 20 s -lrb- ` touchdown ' of  1  c/cycle to 63  c -rrb- , 72  c for 15 s , then 76  c acquisition of signal . as a internal control to account for keratinocyte differentiation in response to ca2 + - stimulation , the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene be measure with each cdna in a separate pcr reaction use intron-spanning primer -lrb- forward primer : 5  - ggc tcc ttc agg cta ENSEMBLGENE tct a -3  , reverse primer : 5  - atc tgg att ctt cag ENSEMBLGENE ttg c -3  -rrb- . this discrepancy may be the result of the inherent technique difficulty of rt-pcr analysis , which we have previously address . for absolute dna quantification , reaction be carry out with different concentration of linearize plasmid dna contain the insert in parallel to the sample that should be quantify . for relative real-time pcr , the datum from one triplicate-sample result of three independent experiment be analyze with software -lrb- GraphPad Prism 4 -rrb- and express as mean  sd of mrna in question relative to that of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ . a recent paper describe this gene base on the register ay827490 gene and publicly available dna datum . the datum from three independent observation be analyze with the software and express as mean  sd of mrna copy in question relative to 10 ng of total rna . the phylogenetic tree construct base on they amino acid sequence support the above idea . homology search be do use the BLAT algorithm as provide by the UCSC Genome Browser -lrb- -rrb- and the ENSEMBLGENE algorithm as provide by the Ensembl server . stimulation be perform for the indicated time with 1.0 mm freshly prepared cacl2 . future work will be necessary to determine the processing of ENSEMBLGENE repeat domain unit and they biological function . all experiment be perform accord to the declaration of Helsinki protocol and under protocol approve by the Ethics Committee at the Medical Faculty of the christian Albrechts University , Kiel , Germany -lrb- A104/06 -rrb- . all specimen be obtain from patient who have sign informed consent form . normal skin specimen be take from routine clinical work at the Department of Dermatology , UKSH Kiel , and represent tumour-free margin of benign melanocytic tumour surgically remove from patient . in addition , skin sample be obtain from untreated patient with DETECTEDPHENO and DETECTEDPHENO vulgari in local anaesthesia . similar to that of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene , , the final huge exon of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene contain highly gc-rich repeat with similar nucleotide sequence . take together , these finding identify ENSEMBLGENE as a novel member of the sftp family present in the granular and horny layer of human epidermis , which might play a role in skin barrier network . since the number of patient investigate be limit -lrb- n = 3 -rrb- , it might be still of interest to investigate the association of the ENSEMBLGENE expression and DETECTEDPHENO in larger cohort . other tissue be derive from normal individual posthumously during autopsy after DETECTEDPHENO arrest . all primer use for various application as describe in the text be design with the primer3 server and order from Sigma -- Aldrich -lrb- Taufkirchen , Germany -rrb- . interestingly , extract obtain from further treatment of the sc sediment with trypsin do not abolish any flg2-immunostaining but result in broad intense band between 45 and 72 kda -lrb- lane 8 -rrb- . Dulbecco 's PBS be obtain from PAA Laboratories gmbh -lrb- clbe , Germany -rrb- . in contrast , there be no obvious staining difference observe between the lesional skin of DETECTEDPHENO patient and the non-lesional skin of the same patient and healthy individual -lrb- n = 3 ; - a and - b -rrb- . restriction endonuclease be from New England Biolabs -lrb- Frankfurt , Germany -rrb- . in the current study we have identify and characterize the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene -lrb- genbank accession number ay827490 -rrb- as a member of the sftp gene family . psoriatic lesion -lrb- n = 3 -rrb- exhibit decrease flg2 immunoreactivity , whereas the non-lesional skin of the same patient exhibit a similar staining pattern as that of healthy individual -lrb- - a and - b -rrb- . to characterize flg2 expression in inflammatory cutaneous disease , lesional and non-lesional skin of patient suffer from DETECTEDPHENO and DETECTEDPHENO dermatitis be investigate . for stimulation and rna isolation , cell be grow in 12-well tissue culture plate -lrb- 4 cm2/well ; BD Biosciences -rrb- and be use after the second passage at a confluence of 70 -- 80 % . such property may cause technical problem for pcr-based amplification and subsequent sequencing , as be also report for analyze the _ plectin _ gene and the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene . the reason be that gc-rich template frequently generate local secondary structure lead to a inefficient pcr amplification . foreskin-derived primary keratinocyte be prepare from neonatal foreskin after surgery follow established method and be culture in epilife medium in 75-cm2 flask -lrb- BD Biosciences , Heidelberg , Germany -rrb- in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % co2 . therefore , it be a technical challenge to efficiently clone and sequence the full-length cdna of this kind of gene . Acetonitril , methanol and h2o -lrb- for hplc -rrb- be obtain from Promochem -lrb- Wesel , Germany -rrb- . all other chemical be order from Sigma -- Aldrich -lrb- Taufkirchen , Germany -rrb- , if not otherwise indicate . total rna be isolate from human skin sample or culture foreskin-derived keratinocyte use the RNeasy Mini kit -lrb- Qiagen , Hilden , Germany -rrb- . a total of 2 g of total rna be reverse transcribe with a oligo -lrb- dt -rrb- 18 primer and superscript ii rnaseh  reverse transcriptase -lrb- Invitrogen , Hamburg , Germany -rrb- . human trichohyalin gene be cluster with the gene for other epidermal structural protein and calcium-binding protein at chromosomal locus 1q21 . all other rna be obtain from BD Bioscience Clontech -lrb- Heidelberg , Germany -rrb- . the amplify product be subclon and sequence . common loss-of-function mutation within the _ flg _ gene cause DETECTEDPHENO vulgari , filaggrin unit represent major risk factor for DETECTEDPHENO dermatitis -lrb- DETECTEDPHENO -rrb- and secondary allergic disease . in the investigation of flg2 immunoreactivity in skin biopsy from patient with DETECTEDPHENO and DETECTEDPHENO vulgari , two of the most common inflammatory skin disease , we have observe decrease expression of flg2 only in the lesional but not in uninvolved skin of DETECTEDPHENO patient . after incubation , cell be harvest by centrifugation and resuspend in 1  LEW buffer -lrb- 50 mm nah2po4 , 300 mm nacl , ph 8.0 -rrb- . this observation be consistent with datum from profilaggrin , where a n-terminal peptide of 32 kda be release after proteolytic processing , suggest the processing of the n-terminal domain of ENSEMBLGENE could be similar to that of filaggrin . however , because of the existence of different ENSEMBLGENE intermediate in the sc , further protein processing can be expect to happen in order to completely generate mature ENSEMBLGENE repeat domain . indeed , reduce expression of ENSEMBLGENE have also be report for DETECTEDPHENO lesion , though _ ENSEMBLGENE _ null allele be not associate with DETECTEDPHENO . because ENSEMBLGENE expression strongly depend on terminal differentiation of keratinocyte , the decrease expression of ENSEMBLGENE might be cause by the altered differentiation in the psoriatic plaque . in contrast , it have be report that hornerin , another member of the sftp family , be strongly express in psoriatic lesion . in DETECTEDPHENO patient , no obvious difference have be observe for ENSEMBLGENE expression in lesional and nonlesional skin . this partial coding region , term flg2-s -lrb- residue 96 to 235 -rrb- , be generate as a pcr fragment use _ pfu Turbo _  dna polymerase -lrb- Stratagene , La Jolla , USA -rrb- . this strategy seem to be the best way to analyze a gene like _ flg2 _ with highly similar sequence and gc-rich repeat at dna level . coli _ -lrb- _ e. coli _ -rrb- be perform by molecular subcloning of a partial ENSEMBLGENE cdna into prokaryotic expression vector . recombinant protein expression of flg2 cdna in _ escherichia . two expression vector , pet-sumo -lrb- invitrogen -rrb- and pet-32a -lrb- Novagen , North Ryde , Australia -rrb- , be use in this study . one primer pair pet-ifps-2-f and pet-ifps-2-r -lrb- -rrb- be use to introduce the cloning site _ bgl_ii and _ not_i site . the pcr product be first subclon into a pgem-t vector -lrb- Promega , Mannheim , Germany -rrb- and then double-digested prior to be clone into the similarly digest pet-32a vector . during terminal differentiation this protein be dephosphorylate and process by several endoprotease to generate two major product : ENSEMBLGENE and the n-terminal peptide . ENSEMBLGENE mainly function to aggregate keratin filament lead to keratinocyte compaction and formation of the sc by conjugation of glutamine-rich linkage protein with lysine-rich protein like p-cystatin , a known cross-linking partner of filaggrin in the sc . the cross-linking possibility of ENSEMBLGENE be support by the detection of natural ENSEMBLGENE protein under reduce condition . a similar mechanism can be suggest for ENSEMBLGENE repeat to aggregate lysine-rich protein because these repeat almost lack cysteine or lysine residue but contain high glutamine contents , implicate that they may act as amino acceptor in transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction to generate glutaminyl-lysine cross-link with neighbouring protein . the first round 3  race-pcr product be use as the template for pcr use BD Advantage 2 polymerase mix under the following condition : 1 min at 95  c , 30 cycle of 20 sec at 95  c and 90 sec at 70  c , and a final extension of 10 min at 70  c . Profilaggrin be a insoluble , highly phosphorylate protein , which consist of multiple ENSEMBLGENE unit join by linker peptide . flg2 immunoreactivity be present as flg2 granule in granular cell but be diffusely distribute in the cytoplasm of cornified cell . however , ENSEMBLGENE and filaggrin do not show complete colocalization . both construct be transform into _ e. coli _ top10 -lrb- invitrogen -rrb- and select on lb agar plate contain appropriate antibiotic . these datum suggest that ENSEMBLGENE and filaggrin might have not any direct intermolecular cross-linking between each other but may play a similar role in skin biology . in the epidermis and hair follicle , the localization of ENSEMBLGENE be similar to that of filaggrin but be different from that of hornerin or trichohyalin . indeed , we have fail to clone the length cdna sequence of ENSEMBLGENE by long-distance rt-pcr -lrb- datum not show -rrb- . more importantly , the primer pair use for successful determination of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ cdna -lrb- -rrb- should be crucial for detailed functional analysis of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene in the future . the pet-sumo-derived expression construct , on the other hand , be transform into _ e. coli _ bl21 -lrb- de3 -rrb- _ plys_s cell -lrb- novagen -rrb- and select on lb agar plate contain kanamycin -lrb- 50 g / ml -rrb- and chloramphenicol -lrb- 34 g / ml -rrb- . the pet-32a-derived expression construct be transform into _ e. coli _ bl21_trxb _ -lrb- de3 -rrb- _ plys_s cell -lrb- Novagen , North Ryde , Australia -rrb- and select on lb agar plate contain carbenicillin -lrb- 50 g / ml -rrb- , chloramphenicol -lrb- 34 g / ml -rrb- and kanamycin -lrb- 15 g / ml -rrb- . clone be sequence to check for any mutation that might have be misincorporate during the amplification . transformant be grow at 37  c and 200 rpm in lb medium contain appropriate antibiotic to a od600 of 0.4 to 0.6 . protein expression be induce with 1 mm iptg -lrb- isopropyl-beta-d-thio-galactopyranoside -rrb- for 3 h . molecular identification and expression analysis of filaggrin-2 , a Member of the s100 fused-type protein family

be low user have a DETECTEDPHENO of 1.86 -lrb- 95 % ci = 1.16 -- 2.99 -rrb- and high user a DETECTEDPHENO of 2.00 -lrb- 95 % ci = 1.28 -- 3.15 -rrb- compare to those with no use of terbufo , while man carry the cc genotype do not exhibit a significant association . _ conclusion _ . since several pesticide be lipophilic or be metabolize via lipid-related mechanism , they may interact with variant of gene in the lipid metabolism pathway . also , use of pesticide , such as phorate -lrb- -rrb- , fonofo -lrb- -rrb- , butylate -lrb- -rrb- , and coumapho -lrb- -rrb- , have be link with a increase risk of DETECTEDPHENO cancer among ah participant with a family history of DETECTEDPHENO cancer . all participant be self-identified as caucasian and confirm to be of european ancestry use population substructure evaluation and principal component analysis as previously describe -lrb- -rrb- . recent finding from this study have identify significant pesticide interaction for several genetic variant in the 8q24 region -lrb- -rrb- , xenobiotic metabolism pathway -lrb- -rrb- , and dna repair pathway -lrb- , -rrb- . in this analysis , we evaluate single nucleotide polymorphism -lrb- snp -rrb- in gene relate to lipid metabolism since there be evidence that lipogenic enzyme and serum lipid may play a role in prostate carcinogenesis via inflammatory , oxidative stress and insulin-resistance mechanism -lrb- , -rrb- . we find 17 interaction that display a significant monotonic increase in DETECTEDPHENO cancer risk with pesticide exposure in one genotype and no significant association in the other genotype . the false discovery rate -lrb- FDR -rrb- be use to account for multiple comparison . _ method _ . lipid metabolism process have be implicate in prostate carcinogenesis . we conduct a DETECTEDPHENO cancer nested case-control study within the AHS to examine interaction between prespecified genetic pathway and pesticide exposure . case be male diagnose with incident DETECTEDPHENO cancer between 1993 and 2004 , and control be male alive at the time of case diagnosis with no cancer diagnosis , except nonmelanoma skin cancer at the time of selection . cellular and molecular study have report a overexpression of lipogenic enzyme , such as fatty acid synthase and acetyl-coa carboxylase , and increase lipogenesis in prostate cancer cell -lrb- , -rrb- . in the Agricultural Health Study -lrb- AHS -rrb- , a significant excess of DETECTEDPHENO cancer be observe among private and commercial pesticide applicator compare to the general population -lrb- , -rrb- . to be eligible for this nested case-control study , participant have to provide a mouth-wash rinse buccal cell sample , and could not have have a previous cancer diagnosis except for non-melanoma skin cancer . we examine potential gene-environment interaction between snp in gene involve in lipid metabolism and pesticide exposure in a nested case-control study within the AHS . previous study of DETECTEDPHENO cancer have show elevated rate in agricultural and pesticide manufacturing population -lrb- , -rrb- . participant be licensed private pesticide applicator -lrb- mostly farmer -rrb- reside in Iowa and North Carolina and commercial applicator reside in Iowa . these questionnaire collect comprehensive datum on lifetime use of 50 pesticide . cancer diagnosis be identify by linkage with population-based state cancer registry . among the 220 snp in 59 gene and 39 pesticide examine in interaction analysis , we find 16 interaction significant at FDR _ p _ interaction < 0.2 accounting for all 220 snp per pesticide . . . we calculate or and 95 % ci for DETECTEDPHENO cancer risk and pesticide exposure stratify by genotype -lrb- homozygous wild-type , heterozygous and homozygous variant -rrb- use unconditional logistic regression model adjust for age and state . . . pesticide use be quantify as ever/never use , lifetime exposure day -lrb- year of use  day per year -rrb- , and intensity weighted lifetime exposure day -lrb- lifetime exposure day  intensity score -rrb- . we compare the distribution of select characteristic -lrb- age -lrb- < 40 , 40 -- 49 , 50 -- 59 , 60 -- 69 ,  70 -rrb- , state of residence -lrb- Iowa , North Carolina -rrb- , applicator type -lrb- private , commercial -rrb- , and first-degree family history of DETECTEDPHENO cancer -lrb- no , yes -rrb- -rrb- between case and control use a chi-square test . this allow we to better understand potential carcinogenic hazard and further public health research on the human health effect of pesticide . genotype be conduct with a custom Infinium BeadChip assay -lrb- iselect -rrb- from Illumina Inc. , at the NCI Core Genotyping Facility . due to small sample size we be unable to evaluate interaction by DETECTEDPHENO cancer stage or grade . furthermore , several pesticide be lipophilic or be metabolize via a lipid-related mechanism -lrb- , -rrb- , suggest that variant of gene involve in lipid metabolism may interact with certain pesticide to increase the risk of DETECTEDPHENO cancer . genetic variant involve in fatty acid or lipid metabolism , which have be link to altered expression of lipogenic enzyme and serum lipid level -lrb- -- -rrb- , have also be associate with a excess risk of DETECTEDPHENO cancer -lrb- -- -rrb- . a detailed description of the AHS cohort have be publish -lrb- -rrb- . of the sample genotype , 108 be remove due to insufficient or poor dna quality -lrb- 14 case , 6 control -rrb- or < 90 % completion rate -lrb- 47 case , 41 control -rrb- , leave 2,220 -lrb- 776 case , 1,444 control -rrb- for statistical analysis . genetic variant be code use a dominant genetic model due to the potential for small sample size of variant allele . germline dna be extract from buccal cell use autopure -lrb- qiagen -rrb- at Sera Care , Frederick , MD. . . we examine 39 pesticide that be ever use by at least 10 % of the study population . association between the 1,895 lipid metabolism snp in 85 gene and DETECTEDPHENO cancer risk be assess use PLINK software -lrb- -rrb- use a log-additive genetic model to calculate odd ratio -lrb- DETECTEDPHENO -rrb- and 95 % confidence interval -lrb- ci -rrb- . pairwise linkage disequilibrium -lrb- e.g. , _ d _  and _ r_2 -rrb- between snp be evaluate use Haploview 4.2 -lrb- -rrb- . briefly , 57 , 310 , or 82 % , of pesticide applicator seek pesticide licensing in Iowa and North Carolina be enrol in the study between December 13 , 1993 and December 31 , 1997 . eligible control be randomly select and frequency match 2 : 1 to case by date of birth -lrb-  1 year -rrb- . information on pesticide use be obtain from two self-administered questionnaire complete at enrollment . since we _ a priori _ hypothesis be a increase risk of cancer with exposure , we focus on statistically significant monotonically increase or with increase pesticide exposure in one genotype and no significant association in the other genotype -lrb- quantitative interaction -rrb- , versus a interaction with increase pesticide exposure in one genotype and a decrease pesticide exposure in the other genotype -lrb- qualitative interaction -rrb- , since the former be consider to be more biologically plausible and less due to chance -lrb- -rrb- . common snp -lrb- minor allele frequency  5 % -rrb- with a _ r_2 threshold > 0.80 be select from the HapMap Project population use the Tagzilla software package that implement a modify tag snp selection method describe by Carlson et al. -lrb- -rrb- . the two most significant snp-cancer association be for two highly correlate variant in _ ENSEMBLGENE , _ rs1835815 , and rs2278356 -lrb- _ r_2 = 0.89 , FDR _ p _ main effect = 0.01 -rrb- . briefly , case and control be similar in term of age , state of residence and applicator type , but case be more apt to have a family history of DETECTEDPHENO cancer . characteristic of the study population -lrb- see Supplementary Table 1 in Supplementary Material available online at doi :10.1155 / 2012/358076 -rrb- and association between intensity-weighted lifetime day of pesticide use and DETECTEDPHENO cancer -lrb- Supplementary Table 2 -rrb- be previously publish -lrb- -- -rrb- . blind duplicate sample -lrb- 2 % -rrb- be genotype ; the concordance of these sample range from 96 -- 100 % . although some of we finding may be false-positive , we adopt a two-stage interaction approach and utilize FDR to limit this possibility . the Illumina chip include 26 , 512 snp , of which 1,858 tag snp in 85 gene be relate to the lipid metabolism pathway . Fonofos interact with a variant in _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- atp-binding cassette , sub-family g member 8 -rrb- , which encode a protein that be a member of the atp-binding cassette transporter that promote biliary excretion of sterol -lrb- -rrb- . we use the false discovery rate -lrb- FDR -rrb- -lrb- -rrb- to account for multiple comparison for the main effect association and the interaction . in essence , we adopt a two-stage interaction approach -lrb- -rrb- , where we first set a cut point on the snp we include in the interaction analysis , and then cut point on the _ p _ interaction value to increase statistical power . the overall genotyping rate for lipid metabolism snp be between 97 % and 100 % . . the intensity score be compute from a algorithm that take into account exposure-modifying factor of how pesticide be use and apply -lrb- -rrb- . exposure for each pesticide be categorize as nonexposed , low , and high exposure , with low - and high-exposure category base on the median intensity-weighted lifetime day . participant be ask how many year -lrb- 1 year or less , 2 -- 5 , 6 -- 10 , 11 -- 20 , 21 -- 30 , or more than 30 year -rrb- and how many day -lrb- less than 5 , 5 -- 9 , 10 -- 19 , 20 -- 39 , 40 -- 59 , 60 -- 150 , or more than 150 day -rrb- in a average year they apply each chemical . interaction analysis be conduct use the dominant genetic model since the number of participant in the homozygous variant group be often small ; however , this may have result in loss of statistical power if another genetic model be more appropriate . for the main effect association , FDR be calculate consider all snp within each gene . for the interaction analysis , we calculate FDR in two way : -lrb- 1 -rrb- accounting for the 220 snp we evaluate per pesticide , which be the most stringent approach , and -lrb- 2 -rrb- accounting for the number of snp within each gene per pesticide . among these , the most noteworthy association -lrb- i.e. , smallest FDR _ p _ interaction and pesticide _ p _ trend -rrb- be for eptc and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ rs916055 . of the 1,895 lipid metabolism snp in 85 gene we examine , 20 snp in 8 gene -lrb- _ abcg5 _ , _ aloxe3 _ , _ amacr _ , _ foxa3 _ , _ lrp2 _ , _ PPARA _ , _ tbxas1 _ , _ ucp3 _ -rrb- be significant use a gene-based FDR < 0.05 . Terbufos also interact significantly with _ ENSEMBLGENE _ rs2072159 -lrb- FDR _ p _ interaction = 0.01 -rrb- and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ rs12733285 -lrb- FDR _ p _ - interaction = 0.02 -rrb- . it be also possible that mechanism other than lipid metabolism might play a role in the interaction we observe since most of the gene we identify have multiple function . this association persist after adjust for _ ENSEMBLGENE _ rs6503086 , which have a significant main effect association with DETECTEDPHENO cancer -lrb- FDR _ p _ trend = 0.02 -rrb- but be not correlate with rs3027208 -lrb- _ r_2 = 0.02 -rrb- . furthermore , since this be the first study to explore the interaction between specific pesticide use and variant of gene in the lipid metabolism pathway , we result require replication . . unless otherwise indicate , analysis be conduct use ENSEMBLGENE , version 9.1 -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE Institute , Cary , NC -rrb- and AHS datum release version p1rel0712 .04 . these 17 association involve seven pesticide -lrb- atrazine , carbofuran , eptc , fonofo , glyphosate , petroleum oil/distillate , and terbufo -rrb- and 15 snp in 11 gene -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- . overall , the most noteworthy association -lrb- i.e. , smallest FDR _ p _ - interaction and pesticide _ p _ - trend -rrb- be for terbufo and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ rs3027208 . all of these interaction have a significant association between pesticide use and DETECTEDPHENO cancer in at least one genotype group -lrb- _ p _ trend < 0.05 -rrb- , 9 also have a increase risk of DETECTEDPHENO cancer -lrb- DETECTEDPHENO trend > 1.0 -rrb- ; and three be monotonic association -lrb- i.e. , increase cancer risk with increase pesticide use -rrb- and quantitative interaction . . man carry the variant t allele who be low user of terbufo have a DETECTEDPHENO of 1.86 -lrb- 95 % ci = 1.16 -- 2.99 -rrb- and high user a DETECTEDPHENO of 2.00 -lrb- 95 % ci = 1.28 -- 3.15 -rrb- compare to no use of terbufo -lrb- _ p _ trend = 0.001 -rrb- , while man carry the cc genotype do not exhibit a significant association -lrb- FDR _ p _ interaction = 0.01 -rrb- . Atrazine , a triazine herbicide , report to be a endocrine disruptor in animal , be also show to affect the lipid profile of liver and muscle in fish -lrb- -rrb- . Fonofos interact significantly with _ ENSEMBLGENE _ rs4953028 , such that man carry the gg genotype who be low user of fonofo have a DETECTEDPHENO of 1.73 -lrb- 95 % ci = 0.99 -- 3.00 -rrb- and high user a DETECTEDPHENO of 1.94 -lrb- 95 % ci = 1.17 -- 3.20 -rrb- compare to no use of fonofo -lrb- _ p _ trend = 0.004 -rrb- , while man carry the variant a allele do not exhibit a significant association -lrb- FDR _ p _ interaction = 0.02 -rrb- . . Carbofuran interact significantly with _ ENSEMBLGENE _ rs8136914 -lrb- FDR _ p _ interaction = 0.03 -rrb- and with _ ENSEMBLGENE _ rs8110695 -lrb- FDR _ p _ interaction = 0.04 -rrb- . the finding from this method be inclusive of those use the more stringent method . we observe significant interaction with three insecticide , terbufo , fonofo , and carbofuran . we observe significant interaction with four herbicide , eptc , petroleum oil/distillates , glyphosate , and atrazine . hypertriglyceridemia as a possible risk factor for prostate cancer man carry the g allele who be low user of eptc have a DETECTEDPHENO of 1.47 -lrb- 95 % ci = 0.98 -- 2.22 -rrb- and high user a DETECTEDPHENO of 1.63 -lrb- 95 % ci = 1.06 -- 2.50 -rrb- compare to no use of eptc -lrb- _ p _ trend = 0.01 -rrb- , while man carry the a allele do not exhibit a significant association -lrb- FDR _ p _ interaction = 0.01 -rrb- . Petroleum oil interact with variant in three gene -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- . the most significant association -lrb- i.e. , smallest FDR _ p _ - interaction and _ p _ - trend -rrb- be for _ lrp1 _ rs1800159 , such that man carry the a allele who be low user of petroleum oil have a or of 1.26 -lrb- 95 % ci = 0.80 -- 2.00 -rrb- and high user a or of 1.76 -lrb- 95 % ci = 1.12 -- 2.77 -rrb- compare to no use of petroleum oil -lrb- _ p _ trend = 0.01 -rrb- , while man carry the g allele do not exhibit a significant association -lrb- FDR _ p _ interaction = 0.03 -rrb- . Petroleum oil interact with four _ ENSEMBLGENE _ snp -lrb- rs1800159 , rs6581128 , rs795957 , rs7978567 -rrb- that be moderately to highly correlate -lrb- _ r_2 = 0.56 -- 0.88 -rrb- . other noteworthy association include the interaction between glyphosate and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ rs9579645 -lrb- FDR _ p _ interaction = 0.02 -rrb- , and between atrazine and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ rs8110695 -lrb- FDR _ p _ interaction = 0.03 -rrb- as well as _ ENSEMBLGENE _ rs1800159 -lrb- FDR _ p _ - interaction = 0.04 -rrb- , which , as mention above , also interact with petroleum oil . increase DETECTEDPHENO cancer risk have be associate with the insecticide -lrb- terbufo , fonofo , carbofuran -rrb- that we find to interact with lipid metabolism gene in previous study in the AHS . Fonofos have be link to DETECTEDPHENO cancer -lrb- , -rrb- and aggressive DETECTEDPHENO cancer -lrb- -rrb- , and interact significantly with variant in the 8q24 region , and the nucleotide and base excision repair gene -lrb- , -rrb- . we finding support the hypothesis that genetic variation in lipid metabolism gene might modify the association between pesticide and DETECTEDPHENO cancer ; however , the biologic mechanism be unclear . the most significant interaction for petroleum oil be with _ alox5 _ rs7099684 , such that man carry the tt genotype who be low user of petroleum oil have a or of 1.19 -lrb- 95 % ci = 0.76 -- 1.86 -rrb- and high user a or of 1.56 -lrb- 95 % ci = 1.03 -- 2.38 -rrb- compare to no use of petroleum oil -lrb- _ p _ trend = 0.03 -rrb- , while man carry the a allele do not exhibit a significant association -lrb- FDR _ p _ - interaction = 0.02 -rrb- . some pesticide in other class have lipophilic property or be metabolize via lipid-related mechanism -lrb- , -rrb- . further characterization of mono and diglyceride lipase in rat tissue research conduct on the role of lipid metabolism in prostate carcinogenesis suggest that the mechanism be complex , involve a array of intermediate compound that can be modify by other pathway as well as various genetic , anthropometric , dietary , and lifestyle factor -lrb- -rrb- . Petroleum oil also interact significantly with two _ ENSEMBLGENE _ snp -lrb- rs876873 , rs120985760 -rrb- that be highly correlate -lrb- _ r_2 = 0.89 -rrb- . this may be due to organochlorine be of the market for approximately 30 year and have a very small number of participant who be expose to these pesticide . . none of the snp we identify in we analysis be know to be functional or have be identify in publish gwa finding for DETECTEDPHENO cancer -lrb- -rrb- -lrb- -rrb- ; however , they may be in linkage disequilibrium with other functional variant . in this nested case-control study , we evaluate the interaction between pesticide use and snp in gene relate to lipid metabolism . in contrast to the insecticide , none of the four herbicide we identify have be associate with DETECTEDPHENO cancer risk in main effect study in the ah -lrb- petroleum oil -lrb- , -rrb- , eptc -lrb- , , -rrb- , atrazine -lrb- , -rrb- , glyphosate -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- . Terbufos be suggestively link to DETECTEDPHENO cancer -lrb- -rrb- , but significantly with aggressive DETECTEDPHENO cancer -lrb- -rrb- , and show evidence of interaction with variant in the 8q24 region -lrb- -rrb- and xenobiotic metabolism gene -lrb- -rrb- . occupational exposure to terbufo and the incidence of cancer in the agricultural health study with these criterion , we analysis yield seven pesticide -lrb- atrazine , carbofuran , eptc , fonofo , glyphosate , petroleum oil/distillate , and terbufo -rrb- and 15 snp in 11 gene -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- of primary interest . we find 17 interaction that be robust to multiple comparison adjustment and display a significant monotonic increase in DETECTEDPHENO cancer risk with increase pesticide use in one genotype group and no significant association in the other genotype group . in addition , we focus we interpretation on interaction with positive monotonic association between pesticide use and DETECTEDPHENO cancer in one genotype and no significant association in the other genotype , which have greater biological plausibility than qualitative interaction , but could have result in exclusion of potentially relevant interaction . . for example , organosphosphate have be show to inhibit triglyceride and lipoprotein lipase in laboratory mouse -lrb- , , -rrb- . Terbufos interact with a variant in _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- arachidonate lipoxygenase 3 -rrb- , which be involve in a lipoxygenase reaction of a fatty acid that be convert to a molecule involve in the proliferation and specialization of the lipid membrane of the epidermis -lrb- -rrb- . organochlorine be lipophilic and accumulate in animal and human adipose tissue -lrb- , -rrb- ; however , none of the six organochlorine we evaluate interact significantly with the snp we examine . two -lrb- terbufo and fonofo -rrb- of the nine organophophate we examine interact significantly with lipid metabolism gene variant and be associate with a increase risk of DETECTEDPHENO cancer . it interact with two gene belong to the low-density lipoprotein receptor family -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE and ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- . similarly , carbofuran have be link to DETECTEDPHENO cancer -lrb- -rrb- , and interact with variant in the nucleotide excision repair pathway -lrb- -rrb- . however , in previous analysis in the prostate nested case-control study , petroleum oil interact with xenobiotic metabolism gene -lrb- -rrb- . . eptc interact with ENSEMBLGENE , another gene in the lipoxygenase family that be involve in the metabolism of arachidonic and linoleic acid . Petroleum oil , which contain a mixture of hydrocarbon and be also lipophilic , be unique in that it be use as a herbicide , but also as a additive to other pesticide , and so it may have a wide variability in use -lrb- -rrb- . while there be biologic plausibility to the interaction we observe , the specific biological mechanism underlie these interaction be unclear . among the herbicide , eptc , classify as a thiocarbamate , have be report to disrupt the biosynthesis of lipid metabolism in plant -lrb- -rrb- . . it interact with variant in three gene : ENSEMBLGENE -lrb- arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase -rrb- , which transform essential fatty acid into leukotriene -lrb- -rrb- ; ENSEMBLGENE -lrb- low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 -rrb- , which regulate a large endocytic receptor that function in lipoprotein transport -lrb- -rrb- ; ENSEMBLGENE -lrb- acyl-coa synthetase long-chain 5 -rrb- which convert free long-chain fatty acid to fatty acyl-coa ester , and thereby play a key role in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation -lrb- -rrb- . Carbofuran interact with _ a4galt _ -lrb- alpha 1,4-galactosyltransferase -rrb- which be involve in the formation of a glycolipid that provide cellular energy -lrb- -rrb- . the low-density lipoprotein receptor -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- be involve in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by receptor-mediated endocytosis -lrb- -rrb- . Carbofuran belong to another class of insecticide , carbamate , that inhibit cholinesterase and have be show to generate reactive oxygen species and induce lipid peroxidation -lrb- -rrb- . Terbufos also interact with _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE receptor 1 -rrb- that encode the ENSEMBLGENE receptor and mediate ligand activity , fatty acid oxidation , and glucose uptake by ENSEMBLGENE -lrb- -rrb- ; and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- sec14-like protein 2 -rrb- that be involve in lipid-binding and cholesterol biosynthesis -lrb- -rrb- . however , by do this , we may have exclude important snp that modify risk .

DETECTEDPHENO represent a group of skeletal disorder characterize in general by shorten digit in hand and foot due to abnormality in the developmental process of phalanx or metacarpals/metatarsals . the image of the three-dimensional structure of nog-bmp7 complex be produce from the pdb-file 1m4u render by PyMOL molecular Graphics System , Version 1.2 r3pre , Schrdinger , LLC . immunodetection be perform use a anti-nog antibody -lrb- sc-25656 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA -rrb- , and a anti-actin antibody -lrb- a5441 , Sigma-Aldrich , St.Louis , MO , USA -rrb- as primary antibody . clinical investigation have be conduct accord to the principle express in the declaration of Helsinki . western blot analysis be perform as previously describe with minor change : micromass cell be harvest at day 3 and lyse in lysis buffer -lrb- 50 mm hepe , 50 mm nacl , 10 mm edta , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Triton , 100 mm pmsf -rrb- . reported noggin mutation be pcr error . single and co-infection be perform with concentrated viral supernatant adjust to 1  10e07 infectious units/ml . a comprehensive review of reported heritable noggin-associated syndrome and propose clinical utility of one broadly inclusive diagnostic term : nog-related-symphalangism spectrum disorder -lrb- nog-ssd -rrb- . to evaluate chondrogenesis , micromass culture be fix and stain with 0.05 % alcian blue . both ENSEMBLGENE and bmp4 be antagonize efficiently by both , wt-nog and g92e-nog , though less potently than bmp7 . this notion be also support in a larger scale by MacArthur et al. who show that healthy human carry a high number of putative complete loss-of-function mutation in protein-coding gene without phenotypic consequence , suggest a unexpected high degree of redundancy in the human genome . it be predict that for the majority of human gene a single functional allele be sufficient to exert the normal function . cell be plate at a density of 2  10e05 cells/14 l-drop . as both ENSEMBLGENE and bdb be rare genetic disorder , it be very unlikely that g92e-nog cause either of these disease . consider these result , functional assay be indispensable to analyze the potential pathogenicity of a mutation . write informed consent for genetic testing be receive from all analyze individual or by parent on behalf of they child . signal be detect via irdye label secondary antibody -lrb- irdye goat anti rabbit 800 ; IRDye goat anti mouse 680 , LICOR , Lincoln , ne , USA -rrb- and quantify use the Odyssey infrare imaging system -lrb- licor -rrb- . alcian blue staining be quantify after extraction with 6 m guanidine-hcl and spectrophotometically measure at 595 nm . ethical approval of the study be give by the ethical board charit . this imply a population allele frequency of 1/400 . in the exome sequence variant database of the Seattle University -lrb- -rrb- 25 of 10129 allele -lrb- 23 of european american origin ; 2 of african american origin -rrb- be list contain the g92e exchange . for example , genome information of Dr. James Watson by next-generation sequencing technology identify 20 mutation associate with increase disease risk without become manifest in the apparently healthy carrier . DETECTEDPHENO type b1 -lrb- bdb1 ; OMIN # 113000 -rrb- be cause by truncating mutation in the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , whereas bdb2 be the result of mutation in _ ENSEMBLGENE _ . we conclude that the g92e change in ENSEMBLGENE be a polymorphism neither cause BDB nor ENSEMBLGENE . with a ENSEMBLGENE titer of only 1/10 of the bmp titer , bmp7-induced chondrogenesis be nearly completely block whereas all other bmp remain able to induce chondrogenesis at this level of competition . since the g92e amino acid change in ENSEMBLGENE be report to be pathogenic for ENSEMBLGENE in many database , such as the human gene mutation database , parent could be wrongly inform that they child have a ENSEMBLGENE cause mutation when , in fact , a neutral polymorphism have be identify . the clinical relevance of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ missense mutation in ENSEMBLGENE , a rare but fatal genetic disorder , have be a matter of intense discussion for nearly a decade . the necessity of such functional assay for the evaluation of putatively disease cause mutation be recently underline by several study . of this test set of bmp , ENSEMBLGENE be block least efficiently by ENSEMBLGENE but be still able to induce Alcian blue positive nodule when ENSEMBLGENE and ENSEMBLGENE titer be equal . in we opinion it be imperative that this fact become common knowledge and note in the relevant database , and further that other _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mutation describe to cause ENSEMBLGENE be evaluate through experimental test . here we provide evidence base on functional datum that the g92e substitution in the ENSEMBLGENE protein do not cause ENSEMBLGENE but rather represent a rare neutral genetic polymorphism . use a previously establish assay for bmp-induced chondrogenesis in micromass culture , we compare the ability of wt-nog and g92e-nog to block the natural chondrogenesis of the culture . compare to the uninfected control , both wt-nog and g92e-nog inhibit chondrogenesis even when use very low virus titer . g92e-nog be able to block all test bmp in a comparable , dose dependent manner to wt-nog . comparison of the level of inhibition of the bmp by nog show that bmp7 have the highest sensitivity . alteration of bmp signaling pathway -lrb- s -rrb- in skeletal disease bone morphogenetic protein : from local to systemic therapeutics . bmp be initially identify as potent bone inducer by Marshall Urist . code sequence of human _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , mouse _ bmp7 _ and human _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be amplify by pcr and clone into the shuttle vector pslax-13 . chicken micromass culture be primary isolate from limb bud of day 4.5 chicken embryo and perform as previously describe . we further investigate the ability of wt-nog and g92e-nog to inhibit the activity of a set of bmp which be co-express during limb development . for example , in dog the loop be expand yet in non-mammal be completely absent . mutational screening of the bone morphogenetic protein 4 gene in a family with fibrodysplasium ossifican progressiva . to assure that the comparable activity of wt-nog and g92e-nog be not due to difference in protein expression level in the micromass cell , we confirm via western blot that the amount of wt-nog and g92e-nog protein be similar in the cell . polygenic or multifactorial developmental disturbance rather than single gene germline mutation be think to be the cause of many unilateral limb defect , especially with respect to hereditary monogenic DETECTEDPHENO of brachydactyly as these generally manifest bilaterally . genomic dna be extract from peripheral blood sample by standard method . it should be note , that in contrast to previous datum , bmp7 be antagonize very efficiently by ENSEMBLGENE when compare to ENSEMBLGENE , bmp4 and ENSEMBLGENE . furthermore , NOG have be hypothesize to cause fop through decrease antagonism of bmp4 since this bmp be find to be over-expressed in lesion of fop patient . as the test bmp be all know to be crucial player during limb patterning , change in nog affinity for these bmp could have provide a explanation for the hand phenotype of the patient . the code region of tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 gene -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ as well as the flanking intronic sequence be amplify by standard pcr protocol . mouse _ bmp4 _ in rcas-a be provide by pip francis-west , human _ ENSEMBLGENE _ in rcas-a be previously describe . Products be evaluate on a automate capillary sequencer -lrb- Applied Biosystems 3730 , Foster City , CA , USA -rrb- . he toe be normal and he have no DETECTEDPHENO ossification or any other skeletal feature of ENSEMBLGENE such as DETECTEDPHENO and malform cervical vertebra , osteochondroma of the proximal medial tibia , or short , DETECTEDPHENO femoral neck . clinically , he right hand show shorten of the 3rd to 5th digit with a rudimentary finger nail of 4th digit . all of these phenotype be the result of a misregulated bmp signaling pathway during human skeletal development . pcr product be analyze on 2 % agarose gel . hence we expand we approach to compare the ability of g92e-nog and wt-nog to block chondrogenesis in chicken micromass cell express bmps/gdfs know to be essential in limb development . the primer sequence and pcr condition for the molecular testing be previously publish -lrb- for _ ENSEMBLGENE _ : ; for _ ENSEMBLGENE _ : . in 2006 , Shore and colleague link ENSEMBLGENE to chromosome 2q23-q24 and identify the underlying genetic cause of ENSEMBLGENE : a heterozygous point mutation in the ENSEMBLGENE a type i receptor gene -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- , a bmp type i receptor , in all classically affect individual worldwide . in response to such report of the involvement of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mutation in ENSEMBLGENE -- , several study provide evidence that ENSEMBLGENE be not link to _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mutation have also be report -- , establish a unresolved issue regard whether ENSEMBLGENE mutation can cause ENSEMBLGENE . nog activity assay have be successfully establish to investigate the functional activity of nog mutation in bdb2 patient and be use in this study to evaluate the p.g92e substitution . this observation be in contrast to disease cause ENSEMBLGENE mutation like p35r or r167g , where chicken micromass control be show to be less efficiently block compare to the wt-nog . here we provide evidence base on clinical as well as experimental datum that the amino acid change g92e in ENSEMBLGENE do not impair ENSEMBLGENE function but represent a polymorphism of _ ENSEMBLGENE _ . however , in the same publication of Lehmann et al. some bdb cause nog mutation do also not show a loss of inhibitory activity on chicken micromass control cell , like a36p and p187 . _ nog _ , a potent extracellular bmp antagonist , be also consider a candidate gene for ENSEMBLGENE , since ENSEMBLGENE be antagonize by ENSEMBLGENE and also up-regulate _ ENSEMBLGENE _ expression in a negative feedback loop . a main mechanism control the signaling cascade both spatially and temporarily be extracellular antagonist like ENSEMBLGENE . today it be know that bmp function be not restricted to skeletal development and regeneration , but fulfill essential function in several non-skeletal organ include brain , heart , liver , lung , kidney and skin . we investigate the g92e-nog amino acid change in the _ in vitro _ chicken micromass system to test whether this amino acid change might alter ENSEMBLGENE function and potentially cause DETECTEDPHENO or ENSEMBLGENE . both clinically and radiologically , the left hand do not show any abnormality . because the polyglycine loop project out into the solvent away from the ligand-binding interface located on the opposite surface , direct interaction between the substitute loop and bmp signal ligand be preclude . patient follow-up at the age of 4 year reveal that apart from the DETECTEDPHENO brachydactyly the boy be healthy and do not subsequently show any sign of ENSEMBLGENE . DETECTEDPHENO middle and DETECTEDPHENO DETECTEDPHENO and a DETECTEDPHENO proximal phalanx of the 4th finger as well as DETECTEDPHENO middle and distal phalanx of digit iii and v be demonstrate by a hand radiograph . he present with DETECTEDPHENO atypical DETECTEDPHENO type b-like -lrb- bdb-like -rrb- of the right hand and a negative family history . sequencing reveal no mutation in the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene , but a heterozygous substitution c.g275a , p.g92e in the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene . previous to the identification of _ acvr1 _ mutation in FOP , defect in the bmp signaling pathway have be hypothesize to be responsible for ENSEMBLGENE as bmp regulate multiple step in development and can induce heterotopic osteogenesis . due to the apparent lack of uniform structure and thus lack of electron density in the computed map to guide the process , the polyglycine loop could not be model and incorporate into the crystal structure -lrb- 1m4u -rrb- deposit in the PDB . the patient be test for mutation in two candidate gene for BDB , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ . analysis of the healthy parent show that the unaffected father also carry this substitution . the single residue substitution in p.g92e be located within a apparently highly flexible segment of the human ENSEMBLGENE protein call the polyglycine loop that comprise amino acid residue 89 -- 95 . bmp belong to the tgf superfamily and bind extracellularly to a heterotetrameric complex of type i and type ii receptor . nog be a dimeric extra-cellular protein that bind to and sequester the dimeric signal ligand , block recruitment of cell surface receptor into a heteromeric signaling complex and transduction of the signal across the membrane . the general applicability of chicken micromass culture for the evaluation of ENSEMBLGENE cause mutation have be demonstrate as mutation in ENSEMBLGENE do result in change in bmp signaling which can be monitor in this system . however , if a mutation in ENSEMBLGENE result in ENSEMBLGENE due to decrease ENSEMBLGENE antagonism , this would have be readily apparent in the chicken micromass system . imbalance between agonist , antagonist and receptor can result in bmp link disorder . the signal be transmit into the nucleus via phosphorylation of signal molecule like smad , where gene transcription be activate . as there be no difference in bmp4 antagonism compare wt-nog and g92e-nog , we can exclude this path of pathogenicity . the absence of difference between g92e-nog and wt-nog in we functional test support that the observe unilateral atypical bdb-like phenotype in we patient be not due to the polymorphism in _ ENSEMBLGENE _ . this study highlight that a give genetic variation should not be consider pathogenic unless support by functional analysis . noggin -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- be a secrete homodimeric protein . he malformation be more likely cause by a isolate local disruption of embryonic vessel during early development . moreover , the residue at position 92 be distal to and orient away from the ligand-binding interface , consistent with the neutral effect of the substitution on function as a antagonist . nucleotide polymorphism in the Canine Noggin Gene and they distribution among dog -lrb- cani lupus familiari -rrb- breed . it be later show that the identify missense mutation in _ ENSEMBLGENE _ at position c.g617a lead to the amino acid change p.r206h be a activate mutation . viral particle be concentrated via ultra-centrifugation , follow by determination of viral titer through infection of df-1 cell -lrb- atcc : umnsah/df -1 #crl -12203 -rrb- and counting of cell positive for a rca specific antibody . in short , df1 cell be transfect with rca retroviral vector and supernatant harvest at 3 consecutive day . _ De novo _ mutation in the _ NOG _ gene in fop patient be report , include the same guanine to adenine substitution at nucleotide 275 lead to the amino acid change p.g92e that we identify in we patient . the tale of FOP , NOGGIN and MYRISTOYLATION : no DATA , no proof ! the name originate from the observation that high dose of ENSEMBLGENE inject into _ xenopus laevi _ embryo cause excessive head development . characterise and predict haploinsufficiency in the human Genome . response to `` mutation of the noggin and of the activin a ENSEMBLGENE I receptor gene in FIBRODYSPLASIA OSSIFICANS PROGRESSIVA -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- '' by Lucotte et al. . _ in vitro _ mutagenesis for human _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be perform with the QuickChange Site-Directed mutagenesis kit -lrb- Agilent Biotechnologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA -rrb- ENSEMBLGENE , ENSEMBLGENE and bmp7 be clone into rca -lrb- bp -rrb- a. wild-type -lrb- wt -rrb- - _ ENSEMBLGENE _ and g92e - _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be clone into rca -lrb- bp -rrb- b to allow co-expression of ENSEMBLGENE with different bmp . however , compare the biological activity of g92e-noggin with wt-noggin , we observe that g92e-noggin inhibit activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling with equal efficiency as wt-noggin , support that g92e-noggin do not cause pathological effect . we show that ENSEMBLGENE , bmp4 , bmp7 and ENSEMBLGENE be block by wt-nog and g92e-nog comparably in a dose dependent manner . further , use experimental assay for bmp signaling , we do not identify difference between wild-type and mutant nog protein to inhibit control chicken micromass cell . the HISTOPATHOLOGY of FIBRODYSPLASIA OSSIFICANS progressiva - a ENDOCHONDRAL process . cloning into retroviral vector , production of viral supernatant in df1 cell and concentration of viral particle be perform as describe previously . we conclude that p.g92e represent a rare polymorphism of the _ NOGGIN _ gene - cause neither DETECTEDPHENO nor fibrodysplasia ossifican progressiva . however , linkage analysis exclude chromosome 14 , the location of _ bmp4 _ , and no mutation in bmp4 could be find in fop patient . previously , the amino acid change p.g92e in NOGGIN be describe as cause fibrodysplasium ossifican progressiva , a rare genetic disorder characterize by limb malformation and progressive heterotopic bone formation in soft tissue that , like DETECTEDPHENO type b , be cause by increase activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling . interestingly , wt-noggin show different inhibition efficacy towards various bone morphogenetic protein that be know to be essential in limb development . initially , bmp4 be consider a primary candidate as a disease-causing gene as it be over-expressed in lesion of fop patient , in lymphoblastoid cell and in highly vascular pre-osseous fibroproliferative cell . bmp signaling be also alter in fibrodysplasium ossifican progressiva -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE ; OMIM # 135100 -rrb- , a rare and disable autosomal dominant disorder characterize by limb malformation and progressive heterotopic bone formation that lead to complete ankylosis of nearly all joint of the axial and appendicular skeleton . chromosomal assignment of the human gene for bone morphogenetic protein-4 . the patient of european descent be refer to the department of clinical genetics at the age of 22 month . we identify a amino acid change -lrb- p.g92e -rrb- in the bone morphogenetic protein antagonist noggin in a 22-month-old boy who present with a DETECTEDPHENO brachydactyly type b phenotype . localisation of the gene for fibrodysplasium ossifican progressiva -lrb- fop -rrb- to chromosome 17q21-22 and noggin gene as candidate for FOP . genetic testing of the child 's parent reveal the same amino acid change in the healthy father , further support that p.g92e be a neutral amino acid substitution in NOGGIN . DETECTEDPHENO type b be a skeletal malformation that have be associate with increase bone morphogenetic protein pathway activation in other patient . to determine whether g92e-noggin show impaired antagonism that could lead to increase bone morphogenetic protein signaling , we perform functional assay to evaluate inhibition of bmp signaling . we identify g92e-nog in a 22-month-old patient with a atypical DETECTEDPHENO brachydactyly phenotype and in he healthy father .

ENSEMBLGENE have three n-glycosylation site at amino acid position 197 , 212 , and 232 , and in each of they at least one n-acetylglucosamine residue be present in the crystal structure -lrb- -rrb- . thus the activity or the localization be not able to explain the variability in the disease phenotype . _ in vitro _ - study have show that ENSEMBLGENE depalmitoylate s-acylated protein , but its

sample , it be elute into tube contain 1 m hepe , ph 7.0 . the datum indicate that the n-glycosylation of asparagine 197 and 232 be more important for ENSEMBLGENE structure , transport , and function than the n-glycosylation of n212 . the same mutant be also secrete into the media . the relative inefficiency of gene therapy trial to treat ENSEMBLGENE suggest that the trafficking of ENSEMBLGENE may have novel property . to create condition that mimic a homomeric interaction , we mutagenize both the gfp-ppt1 and ENSEMBLGENE construct . interestingly , we show that ENSEMBLGENE express in neuron be differentially modify when compare with non-neuronal ENSEMBLGENE . it consist of 306 amino acid , include a signal sequence of 26 amino acid and three n-linked glycosylation site . the defective gene behind the ENSEMBLGENE disease , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , encode for palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- -lrb- -rrb- . single transfection use pegfp-c1 vector , ppt1-pcmv5 and Herring sperm dna be use as control . the cell be double transfect with mutant ppt1-pcmv5 and gfp-ppt1-pcmv5 -lrb- wild type , r122w , g108r , l219q , and f85del -rrb- construct . the antibody titer and specificity be determine by immunofluorescence , western blot , and immunohistochemistry . in neuron , however , only two glycosylation form could be detect -lrb- figure . glycosylation result in four form of overexpressed ppt1 which can be detect as a 32 kda non-glycosylated form and as 34 , 36 , and 38 kda mono - , di - and triglycosylate form in cos-1 cell -lrb- -rrb- . while most cell type remain unaffected despite the presence of storage material , cortical neuron be lose during the disease process . the mutagenized ppt1 construct , s199a , s214a , and s234a as well as the double-mutant construct s199a + s214a be transfect into cos-1 and helum cell and analyze for activity , processing , and intracellular localization . the activity of all the glycosylation site mutant be greatly reduce , and only the n212 glycosylation site mutant could retain a considerable enzyme activity . ENSEMBLGENE be also demonstrate to form oligomer by size-exclusion chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation assay . ENSEMBLGENE show colocalization with the lysosomal marker lamp-1 -lrb- datum not show -rrb- , while only a small fraction of ENSEMBLGENE be localized to lysosome -lrb- figure . in this study , we also demonstrate that ENSEMBLGENE self-oligomerize _ in vivo _ . ENSEMBLGENE staining be similar to that see in the fibroblast . molecular pathogenesis of a disease : structural consequence of aspartylglucosaminurium mutation the enzyme be transport into lysosome of non-neuronal cell by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor -lrb- m6pr -rrb- mediated pathway -lrb- , -rrb- . sample be analyze with 14 % sds-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotting use a ENSEMBLGENE specific polyclonal antibody . ncl resource , University College London while severe incl-mutation produce inactive enzyme , the mutation cause later onset disease show low residual activity . this be do to spare the polypeptide backbone and the side chain from any major distortion -lrb- , -rrb- . however , the therapeutic study in ppt1-deficient mouse involve aav-mediated ENSEMBLGENE , have ameliorate the cn pathology only in localized area , suggest that the neuronal trafficking of ENSEMBLGENE have undefine feature -lrb- - -rrb- . ok participate in the neuronal cell culture management and design the assay concern the glycosylation mutant . in transfect helum cell , double staining together with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker lamp1 show that the wild type protein reach the lysosome , as do the m1us mutant -lrb- figure and . glycosylation usually prevent aggregation and thus the interaction be not likely to be due to a bias via aggregation of overexpressed protein . a saturating amount of purify ppt1 be covalently attach to a flow cell of a biosensor chip use standard amine coupling accord to the manufacturer 's protocol . one could postulate that the glycosylation be actually similar in these cell , and that the difference see in the number of the band would result from some other modification . in this study , we could observe several new property for neuronal ENSEMBLGENE , include altered modification compare to ENSEMBLGENE in fibroblast . molecular interaction of several ENSEMBLGENE protein have be partially resolve . when the same experiment be repeat in neuron , again a clear difference between ENSEMBLGENE and ENSEMBLGENE antibody internalization be observe . although the crystal structure of the ENSEMBLGENE molecule be establish , very little be currently know about the biological interaction and the molecular structural format of ENSEMBLGENE _ in vivo _ . we datum suggest that ENSEMBLGENE can homodimerize or oligomerize _ in vivo _ . this observation suggest that the transport of recycled ppt1 from the plasma membrane back inside the cell differ from that of AGA in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell . for example , in glucoproteinose , gene therapy and bone marrow transplantation have be advantageous in animal model and even in human study , especially in case where the m6pr-mediated trafficking of the lysosomal enzyme have be show to operate in neuron -lrb- , - -rrb- . even though some aspect of the glycosylation of ENSEMBLGENE have be study previously -lrb- , -rrb- , we want to further analyze the effect of its three n-glycosylation site on the activity , and especially the trafficking of ENSEMBLGENE , a aspect not cover previously . when the n232 glycosylation site be mutate , ENSEMBLGENE localize to the er -- but also partially to lysosome . cell sample be filtrate and fractionate by size-exclusion chromatography . m6p-receptor-mediated trafficking have offer a substantial advance to treat lysosomal storage disorder since most soluble lysosomal enzyme can diffuse in the brain tissue . more importantly , the demonstration of the active enzyme in the large molecular weight fraction of the cell homogenate during the size-exclusion chromatography support a true interaction between ENSEMBLGENE molecule , either directly or via other molecule . thus , the current analysis suggest that the n-glycosylation at asparagine 212 be not crucial for ENSEMBLGENE activity or folding . thus , we datum suggest that the role of m6p-receptor-mediated lysosomal trafficking might not be as crucial for ENSEMBLGENE as it have previously be think . previously , the three n-glycosylation site of ppt1 have be show to be utilize in non-neuronal cell and they effect on ENSEMBLGENE activity have be study by mutagenize the glycosylation site asparagine to glutamine -lrb- -rrb- . recombinant ppt1 be purify from the stably transfect cho-cell -lrb- -rrb- by the method modify from Bellizzi et al -lrb- -rrb- . furthermore , immunoelectron microscopy and cell fractionation study have show that neuronal ENSEMBLGENE be also find in synaptosome and synaptic vesicle -lrb- - -rrb- suggest a additional function for ENSEMBLGENE outside of lysosome . we investigate both intracellular and secrete ENSEMBLGENE by immunoprecipitation and analyze the localization of the enzyme by immunofluorescence . we also show that the same two glycosylation site be need for correct lysosomal targeting of ENSEMBLGENE . transfect cell be then lyse and co-immunoprecipitate with anti-gfp-agarose bead . thus , we datum implicate that glycosylation be important for ENSEMBLGENE activity , and the most important site for it be n197 , follow by n232 and n212 . small vesicle could be find everywhere in the cell , although the staining be particularly strong in the axon . as ppt1 have be categorize as a lysosomal enzyme , we use a subcellular lysosome-containing fraction of pc12 cell as the ENSEMBLGENE source . therefore , we use superose 6hr size-exclusion chromatography on cell lysate to determine whether the intracellular ENSEMBLGENE reside in a monomeric or a complex form . furthermore , ppt1 's distribution in antibody internalization assay be different when compare to a classical lysosomal enzyme AGA , suggest that ppt1 behave differently from the enzyme use mannose 6-phosphate pathway for they endocytosis . all author read and approve the final manuscript . rabbit be immunize by four sequential subcutaneous injection of 160 g of ENSEMBLGENE in Freund 's complete adjuvant . the experiment be replicate several time , and although we could not quantitate the result repeatedly , the analysis demonstrate that all the mutate ENSEMBLGENE polypeptide be able to form homodimeric complex and that the interaction intensity between mutant protein be somewhat stronger than those observe between wild type protein -lrb- figure . ppt1 carry the s234a mutation be secrete into the culture media in low yield , while s199a and s199a + s214a -- mutant be fully non-secretory , suggest that they mostly retain in the er . as suggest by the enzyme activity measurement , ENSEMBLGENE carry the s214a mutation be transport to lysosome whereas the s199a -- mutant be retain in the er . mouse fibroblast and primary neuronal culture be infect with recombinant adenovirus encode ENSEMBLGENE and a control cdna , aspartyglucosaminidase -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- . in general , the accumulation of mutant protein in the er be not consider to affect the phenotype -lrb- -rrb- , although this have not be study in ENSEMBLGENE . to investigate the possible role of mutation in the ability of ENSEMBLGENE to form complex , four different mutation , each cause a different phenotype , be select for gfp-pull down analysis : r122w -lrb- infantile -rrb- , f85del -lrb- late infantile -rrb- , l219q -lrb- juvenile -rrb- , and g108r -lrb- adult -rrb- -lrb- Table . AGA staining be again strongest in the cell soma , typical of its late endosomal/lysosomal localization -lrb- -rrb- and only a few aga-positive vesicle could be see in the neuronal projection -lrb- figure . finally , the consequence of disease mutation be analyze in the perspective of we new result , suggest that the mutation increase both the degree of glycosylation of ENSEMBLGENE and its ability to form complex . AL carry out the protein purification and complex formation experiment as well as the experiment concern the disease mutation , participate in the antibody internalization assay and draft the manuscript . a empty flow cell be use as a negative control . ppt1 activity of mutant protein have be carefully analyze earlier from transfect cos-1 cell lysate , purify protein sample and patient lymphoblast -lrb- , -rrb- . with the antibody internalization assay , trafficking difference could be see both in fibroblast and neuron compare with another lysosomal enzyme ENSEMBLGENE , which be know to utilize the m6p-receptor . the final yield be about 1.15 mg of ENSEMBLGENE per 300 ml of crude medium . expression and endocytosis of lysosomal aspartylglucosaminidase in mouse primary neuron varying concentration of ENSEMBLGENE be dilute in hepe buffer saline -lrb- hb -rrb- with two different ph-value -lrb- 5 and 7.4 -rrb- and use as analyte . while the AGA antibody be endocytose into perinuclear lysosome , the endocytose ppt1 antibody only partially localized to lysosome , mostly retain in small vesicle distribute throughout the cell . aj and t conceive of the study , and AJ participate in its design , coordination and draft the manuscript . the volume of this further purify sample be reduce with centricon ym-10 concentrator -lrb- Millipore -rrb- . understand the basic characteristic of ENSEMBLGENE be fundamental in order to clarify the molecular pathogenesis behind DETECTEDPHENO in ENSEMBLGENE . further study be need to clarify the precise nature of these modification , but phosphorylation and lipid modification could be potential study target . both of the cell type analyze here be infect with the same recombinant ppt1-adenovirus -lrb- -rrb- include the human cdna , so it be unlikely that we finding would result from different splice variant . the undifferentiated pc12 cell be select because they endogenous ppt1 level be high enough for reliable activity measurement . to distinguish whether the self-interaction of ENSEMBLGENE molecule be direct or mediate by other factor , we also perform a direct interaction assay for purify ENSEMBLGENE . under native condition , ENSEMBLGENE exist as a dimer -lrb- ~ 80 kda -rrb- -lrb- -rrb- . ENSEMBLGENE activity be elute in a fraction correspond with the molecular size of a native ENSEMBLGENE homodimer -lrb- figure . a considerable amount of the ppt1 enzyme activity be demonstrate in the fraction represent apparent mw > 100 kda . in this study , we utilize a different strategy for generate the glycosylation site mutation . we conclude that a increase amount of evidence pinpoint the existence of a alternative pathway for ENSEMBLGENE sorting in addition to the m6p-receptor-mediated route . also the deglycosylate polypeptide differ in they size , the neuronal band again migrate in between the two band from fibroblast rather than at the same level with one of they . however , so far the molecular interaction of ENSEMBLGENE have not be analyze in detail . however , this observation could not be repeat in non-neuronal cell , where all the mutant polypeptide be retain in the er . ENSEMBLGENE have be show to interact with both cln2 and ENSEMBLGENE -lrb- -rrb- . ENSEMBLGENE , the protein behind the variant late infantile ENSEMBLGENE , be recently show to form dimer in cross-linkage experiment -lrb- -rrb- . enzyme activity of both ENSEMBLGENE and ENSEMBLGENE be measure from the elution fraction . both gfp-ppt1 and ENSEMBLGENE protein use in the co-immunoprecipitation assay be highly glycosylate . in summary , we datum suggest that the mutate protein utilize they glycosylation site more efficiently than the wild type protein in neuron as well as in other cell type study here . however , the mechanism of cell death have remain elusive . they also show higher degree of oligomerization than the wild type molecule . although the disease be classify as a infantile form of ENSEMBLGENE , the age of onset vary depend on the mutation : nonsense and frameshift mutation always induce the classical infantile disease , whereas some missense mutation also associate with the adult-onset disease form in addition to infantile and juvenile form -lrb- , -rrb- . palmitoylation have be show to play a critical role particularly in neuron , where active vesicular transport and intracellular signalling take place -lrb- review in -lrb- - -rrb- -rrb- . as a result of the mutation , the activity of the ppt1 enzyme be either reduce or abolish , or the expression level of the protein be diminish -lrb- -rrb- . cover slip be transfer to normal growth media for another 2 hour and fix with 4 % pfa . it have be propose that the start codon ata would be utilize in the patient ' tissue , result in low but clinically relevant expression of the normal enzyme -lrb- -rrb- . for the gfp-coimmunoprecipitation assay , cos-1 cell be seed one day before transfection to 92 mm dish and grow to 50 -- 80 % confluency . the neuronal localization of ENSEMBLGENE also vary depend on the disease phenotype : mutation contribute to a severe infantile disease cause the retention of the enzyme in the er , whereas the steady state localization of the protein carry a juvenile-onset disease mutation be reportedly unaffected -lrb- -rrb- . ser72pro active-site disease mutation in human lysosomal aspartylglucosaminidase : abnormal intracellular processing and evidence for extracellular activation the ENSEMBLGENE polypeptide carry a double mutation at the glycosylation site s199a and s214a , also express very low enzyme activity . therefore , we also analyze the intracellular localization of the glycosylation mutate protein in transfect cos-1 cell by immunofluorescence analysis . ENSEMBLGENE be another ENSEMBLGENE protein behind the juvenile form of the disease , show to be localized to endosome and lysosome -lrb- -rrb- . ENSEMBLGENE participate in glycoprotein breakdown by catalyze the cleavage of the n-glycosidic bond between asparagine and n-acetylglucosamine -lrb- -rrb- . interestingly , the activity of ENSEMBLGENE distribute more broadly between the elution fraction . the specificity of the antibody be test by western blot use purify ppt1 and both preimmune and immune rabbit serum for the detection -lrb- datum not show -rrb- . ENSEMBLGENE be a well characterize , classic lysosomal enzyme that have be show to utilize the m6pr-mediated lysosomal transport and endocytosis also in neuron -lrb- -rrb- . this result indicate that a significant amount of native ENSEMBLGENE reside in a complex rather than in a monomeric form . another ENSEMBLGENE activity peak be observe in fraction that most probably represent the monomeric form -lrb- 36 -- 38 kda -rrb- of the enzyme -lrb- figure . cos-1 cell be double transfect with both gfp-ppt1 fusion protein and wild type ENSEMBLGENE construct . ENSEMBLGENE carry glycosylation site mutation s199a and s234a be detect as doublet and s214a as a major single band , suggest that both of the remain glycosylation site be effectively use in the case of this mutant . for glycosylation degree analysis , 10 g of total protein be assay with 14 % sds-page and immunoblotting use a ENSEMBLGENE specific polyclonal antibody . to further investigate the observe _ in vivo _ complex formation of ENSEMBLGENE , we analyze the possible self-oligomerization of ENSEMBLGENE by use co-immunoprecipitation assay . j participate in the activity assay and the design of glycosylation mutant . the ppt1 activity assay be perform as describe earlier -lrb- -rrb- use 5 g of total protein from crude cell lysate or 30 l from size-exclusion chromatography fraction . earlier study have show that ENSEMBLGENE with a single mutation at any of the three possible glycosylation site be still capable of obtain a mannose-6-phosphate -lrb- m6p -rrb- tag on its sugar structure and bind to m6p-receptor -lrb- -rrb- . ENSEMBLGENE have be crystallize as a monomer from a secrete protein sample -lrb- -rrb- . the amount of release 4-mu be determine with a fluorometer . neither could we detect oligomerization in a secrete , monomeric sample . thus it be possible that the intracellular oligomerization of ENSEMBLGENE involve other , yet unresolved molecule . rather than change the specific asparagine to another amino acid , we alter the glycosylation site consensus sequence n-x-s/t by mutate serine to alanine . single n  Q mutation be report to cause only minor effect on ENSEMBLGENE activity , and double mutation result in a minimum of 20 % activity . the purify enzyme be then use to analyze direct dimerization of ENSEMBLGENE in a plasmon resonance energy transfer assay use Biacore application . as the residual ENSEMBLGENE enzyme activity of mutant protein have not correlate with the disease phenotype , previous study have propose that decrease enzyme stability play a major role in determine the phenotype -lrb- -rrb- . a late onset mutation m1us display almost full activity -lrb- 87.5 % of wild type -rrb- as analyze by overexpression in cos-1 cell . the g108r polypeptide fully colocalize with the er marker pdus in helum cell be well in line with earlier finding -lrb- -rrb- . in we study , we mutagenize the serine to alanine in each ENSEMBLGENE n-glycosylation consensus site -lrb- n-x-s/t -rrb- since substitution of serine in the motif supposedly cause only minimal distortion to the polypeptide structure -lrb- -rrb- . after co-immunoprecipitation with gfp-agarose and western blot detection with ppt1 antibody , we compare the extent of dimerization of the mutate polypeptide with that of the wild type protein , take into account the difference in the expression level -lrb- figure . in the current study we could not define the molecular basis for the adult phenotype cause by the g108r mutation . mutation in glycosylation site of ENSEMBLGENE have be show to affect protein folding and degradation , enzymatic activity , lysosomal sorting , and transport -lrb- -rrb- . it can be conclude that the enzyme activity level _ per se _ can not be use to distinguish later onset disease from each other . as control , we use gfp-cln3 and gfp-aire fusion protein -lrb- , -rrb- . we further analyze the possible disparity in neuronal transport of ppt1 and utilize a antibody internalization assay to compare recycling of ppt1 between non-neuronal and neuronal cell . we current observation support this suggestion , since also the intracellular localization of this mutant be uniform with wild type enzyme both in helum cell and neuron . we further describe the ability of ENSEMBLGENE to form complex . notably , no difference could be see in the glycosylation level between the mutant protein cause late or early onset phenotype . the blood be collect two week after the last immunization and the serum be further affinity purify use gst-ppt1 fusion protein . western blot analysis of the co-immunoprecipitate , detect by ENSEMBLGENE antibody , show that both the wild type ENSEMBLGENE and the gfp-ppt1 be present , indicate that gfp-ppt1 and ENSEMBLGENE interact with each other -lrb- figure . mutant s234a show partial localization to lysosome , although a major proportion be retain in the er -lrb- figure . the s214a polypeptide be also secrete into the culture media , demonstrate that this protein be able to pass the quality control system of the er for secretion . a clinical study of 15 patient 1 . this may implicate that ppt1 have some functional role along the secretary pathway . binding of ENSEMBLGENE with itself be study with surface plasmon resonance analysis in a Biacore 2000 biosensor -lrb- biacore -rrb- . the buffer be then change to 5 mm hepe , 150 mm nacl and the sample be apply to a hr-12 column for size-exclusion chromatography . for ppt1 enzyme activity and western blot analysis , transfect cos-1 cell and sfv-infected mouse primary hippocampal neuron be wash twice with cold PBS and lyse with freeze-thaw-cycle in water supplement with protease inhibitor -lrb- complete , Roche -rrb- . cv carry out the experiment with the glycosylation mutant and help to draft the manuscript . several study have suggest a extralysosomal localization of ppt1 in neuronal cell -lrb- - , -rrb- , implicate neuron specific property for ENSEMBLGENE . ENSEMBLGENE do not co-precipitate with either of these fusion protein -lrb- figure . the g108r and ppt1fin - mutant harbour a amino acid substitution in the middle of the polypeptide chain , and thus likely to have disturbance in they folding , present mostly the tri - and diglycosylated form of the protein in cos-1 cell -lrb- figure . therefore we analyze the activity of ENSEMBLGENE carry g108r and include two other mutant in the analysis , namely m1us -lrb- late infantile -rrb- and r122w , also denote as pptfin , -lrb- infantile -rrb- , the latter as a known inactive control . da and co-worker have show that the n232q mutation in ENSEMBLGENE have the greatest effect on m6p-receptor binding . evidently ppt1g108r can delay the development of the disease until adulthood without reach the synaptic vesicle . prominent difference in the endocytic trafficking of ENSEMBLGENE can be see when compare to a well characterize lysosomal hydrolase . western blot analysis show that in mouse fibroblast all three glycosylation form of ENSEMBLGENE be present , the diglycosylated form be the most prominent . after a one-hour pulse follow by a 2-hour chase , the mature wild-type ppt1 be detect as a doublet of 36/38 kda both in the cell and the media -lrb- figure . study on the n-glycosylation of the subunit of oligosaccharyl transferase in saccharomyces cerevisiae the intracellular processing of the glycosylation mutant be analyze by metabolic labelling and immunoprecipitation . the mutagenesis of the patient mutation m1us -lrb- c3g > a -rrb- , f85del -lrb- c252-254delctt -rrb- , g108r -lrb- c322g > c -rrb- , y109d -lrb- c325t > g -rrb- , r122w -lrb- c364a > t -rrb- , q177e -lrb- c529c > g -rrb- , v181m -lrb- c541g > a -rrb- and l219q -lrb- c656t > a -rrb- , be perform in the ppt1-pcmv5 and gfp-ppt1-pcmv5 use a site-directed mutagenesis kit accord to the manufacturer 's protocol -lrb- stratagene -rrb- . the reading frame be confirm with abi3730 Automatic DNA sequencer use the BigDye  Terminator Cycle sequencing kit v3 .1 -lrb- Applied Biosystems -rrb- . recombinant Semliki Forest virus -lrb- sfv -rrb- encode the wild type ENSEMBLGENE be construct as previously describe -lrb- -rrb- . neuronal g108r be transport further to the extension but do not colocalize with the presynaptic marker , the target for the wild type and m1us polypeptide . AIRE be a nuclear protein participate in t-cell maturation . further research be need to locate the place -lrb- s -rrb- of action for neuronal ENSEMBLGENE and to clarify the molecular network affect by ENSEMBLGENE deficiency . c57/bl wt and c57/bl _ ppt1_ex4 mouse -lrb- -rrb- be breed and house in National Public Health Institute 's facility . Free 4-MU -lrb- Sigma -rrb- dilute in stop-buffer -lrb- 0.5 m nahco3/na2co3 ph 10.7 , 0.025 % Triton x-100 -rrb- be use as a standard . MJ participate in the study design concern the complex formation . this antibody be raise in rabbit against recombinant ENSEMBLGENE produce by the baculovirus expression system -lrb- code 8414 -rrb- -lrb- -rrb- . we current study describe novel property for ENSEMBLGENE . size-exclusion chromatography of the sample be perform with a Superdex 75 column -lrb- _ v _ = 25 ml , Amersham Pharmacia Biotech -rrb- in PBS at room temperature . the current study also demonstrate that intracellular transport and maturation of ENSEMBLGENE show property that differ from those involve in the classic mannose 6-phosphate receptor mediate sorting . disease mutation result in a classic early onset or later onset form of ENSEMBLGENE be show to have a effect both on the glycosylation degree of ENSEMBLGENE and its ability to form complex , but neither of these phenomenon could explain the genotype-phenotype correlation . in this study we show that the n-glycosylation of asparagine 197 and 232 be important for ENSEMBLGENE activity . however , the result of the Biacore analysis show that purify ppt1 be not capable of interact with itself under these _ in vitro _ condition -lrb- figure -rrb- suggest that other as of yet unknown factor mediate the subcellular complex formation of ENSEMBLGENE . most importantly , clarification of the neuronal transport property of ENSEMBLGENE will offer a basis for develop novel therapeutic strategy . we perform a immunoblot analysis from the lysate derive from both transfect cos-1 cell and sfv-infected neuron . also in this study , the overexpressed ENSEMBLGENE carry the adult phenotype mutation g108r be show to have only a low activity of 3.5 % . this suggest that the dimer formation and dissociation may occur reversibly also in the case of ENSEMBLGENE . this may represent a means to regulate the activation and/or transport of the enzyme . to approach this question , we overexpress ENSEMBLGENE both in mouse fibroblast and neuron and compare the apparent molecular weight of non-neuronal and neuronal ENSEMBLGENE . the aspartylglucosaminidase -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- activity assay be base on the colorimetric measurement of liberated n-acetylglucosamine from the synthetic substrate 2-acetamido-1- - -lrb- l-aspartamido -rrb- -1,2 - dideoxy--d-glucose -lrb- aadg -rrb- as describe earlier -lrb- -rrb- . t participate in the study design and molecular cloning of the disease mutation construct . previous study have report some correlation between the disease mutation phenotype and the localization of ENSEMBLGENE -lrb- -rrb- . mutation in ENSEMBLGENE have be show to result in disease with variable age of onset and progression . no overlap with the golgus marker or the lysosomal marker be detect -lrb- datum not show -rrb- . as expect , both ENSEMBLGENE and ENSEMBLGENE antibody be internalize in adenovirus-infected mouse fibroblast . this confirm that the initiator codon mutation m1us -lrb- atg  ata -rrb- result only in a reduce expression level of ppt1 and do not affect the natural intracellular transport of the protein from er to lysosome . human leucocyte aspartylglucosaminidase . the subcellular localization of mutate ppt1 have be show to vary , depend on the cell type and on the type of mutation -lrb- , , , -rrb- . the activity of the wild type and mutant enzyme be analyze in transiently transfect cos-1 cell and the datum be normalize by immunoblotting and densitometric scanning for the expression level of ppt1 -lrb- figure . we observe difference in ppt1 processing and trafficking in neuronal and non-neuronal cell , and describe for the first time the ability of ENSEMBLGENE to form complex . they localize in the projection of the cell , partially colocalize with the synaptic vesicle marker ENSEMBLGENE -lrb- figure and . the column be wash with 5 mm hepe buffer with decrease salt concentration and ENSEMBLGENE be elute with 5 mm hepe , 70 % ethanol , ph 7.9 . as a control , pptfin be lack the enzyme activity completely . the pellet be resuspend in D'ell Angelica buffer -lrb- see above -rrb- and filtrate with 0.22 m spin-x filter tube -lrb- costar -rrb- . in contrast , the adult onset mutation g108r show approximately 4 % activity compare with that of the wild type enzyme . the initiator codon mutation m1us result in the enzyme display a nearly full activity but reduce expression . also the effect of known missense mutation on ENSEMBLGENE activity have previously be explore -lrb- , , -rrb- , but the g108r mutation result in a adult phenotype have not be examine in a overexpress system -lrb- -rrb- . we use immunofluorescence staining in transiently transfect helum cell and recombinant sfv-infected mouse primary neuron to further map previously unknown intracellular localization of mutant protein m1us and g108r . for example , acyl protein thioesterase 1 -lrb- apt1 -rrb- , a functional relative for ENSEMBLGENE , form a dimer which have to dissociate before the enzyme display activity -lrb- -rrb- . construction of recombinant adenovirus ad-ppt1wt and ad-agawt and the adenovirus infection protocol have be describe previously -lrb- , -rrb- . immunoprecipitation be carry out with fix _ staphylococcus aureus _ cell -lrb- calbiochem -rrb- use a gst-ppt antibody -lrb- 1:700 -rrb- . a rapid fluorogenic palmitoyl-protein thioesterase assay : pre - and postnatal diagnosis of incl in short , 5 l of total protein be treat with 2 l of pngasef in 20 l reaction buffer for 1 -- 16 h at 37  C.

ENSEMBLGENE be know to interact with rbfox1 -lrb- -rrb- and pc-specific deletion of rbfox1 and rbfox 2 result in splicing abnormality in several gene , include ion channel-forming gene in pc . during the study of the atxn2q58 mouse model , we also have generate two line express a human _ ENSEMBLGENE _ cdna encode q22 , the most common normal allele in human population . in human , mutation in _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- kv3 .3 -rrb- which be predict to alter ENSEMBLGENE firing can lead to progressive cerebellar degeneration . finally , deficit in motor behavior become significant at 8 week . count be perform with image make from the ` Fissura Prima ' between lobe v and VI along the mid-sagittal plane . we perform rt-pcr on sample from both young -lrb- 4 week -rrb- and older -lrb- 24 week -rrb- WT and mutant mouse -lrb- fig . -rrb- despite the marked decrease in firing frequency , the firing regularity remain remarkably constant in _ atxn2q127_mice and no statistically significant difference be observe for age or genotype -lrb- two-way ANOVA , Fig . a positive modulator of calcium-activated potassium channel restore regular firing and ameliorate ataxic symptom in these model , indicate that the pattern as well as the rate of ENSEMBLGENE firing likely impact motor coordination . no alternative splice difference be detect between _ atxn2q127 _ mouse and wt litter mate sample in any of the three ca2 + channel : _ cacna1b _ , _ cacna1d _ and _ cacna1 _ -lrb- fig . -rrb- the ao of sca2 symptom exhibit a inverse correlation to the number of glutamine repeat . the pc-specific double-mutant animal show dysregulation of rna splicing for a number of ion channel transcript know to be implicate in ENSEMBLGENE pacemaking . . the datum discuss in this report , however , suggest that mutant _ atxn2q127 _ be not exert its toxic effect on ENSEMBLGENE pacemaking via association with rbfox1 . in brief , age-matched WT and _ atxn2q127 _ mouse be anesthetized use isoflurane and decapitate in accordance with the protocol approve by the University of California Los Angeles Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . intriguingly , rbfox1 be initially identify and name ataxin2-binding protein1 base on a yeast 2 hybrid screen use ataxin2 protein as bait . in the rbfox 1 and 2 , ko mouse model variation of the firing frequency be significantly higher than wt animal . _ grid2 : _ -lrb- gttggtctcgacctgggac ;

Figure A -- j show representative image of WT -lrb- top row -rrb- and _ atxn2q127 _ cerebellar section -lrb- bottom row -rrb- across five different age point -lrb- column -rrb- . the majority of pc fire regularly and we observe only a very small fraction of burst cell which show no difference between the WT and transgenic group -lrb- fig . the ENSEMBLGENE firing frequency be also reduce in a triplet repeat model of sca3 -lrb- -rrb- , but this reduction likely occur by a different pathophysiological mechanism . the reduce expression of these gene be not a function of ENSEMBLGENE death , as number of pc between WT and _ atxn2q127 _ remain relatively constant until 40 week of age . sca commonly show disease onset in early adulthood with progressive worsening of symptom with age . for Huntington disease , another polyglutamine disorder , early disease stage may result more from dysfunction than cell death as show by recent electrophysiological study in yac mouse . these physiological datum correlate with the rotarod behavior which show no evidence of impairment at early age but progressively worsen over a similar age range . a reduce expression of _ calb1 _ be follow by a significant reduction in _ pcp2 _ , _ grm1 _ and _ grid2 _ expression at 8 week , each of which also demonstrate a progressive diminish expression with age . for polyq DETECTEDPHENO , this have be support in a animal model of sca1 , where DETECTEDPHENO and physiological change clearly precede ENSEMBLGENE loss and reduction in dendritic volume . it be also possible that atxn2q127 interact with specific ion channel protein require for pacemaking , explain the reduction in this canonical physiological behavior of pc . along with the overt motor phenotype , we observe anatomical abnormality associate with expression of the transgene in mutant mouse , although at latter age . with age , however , _ atxn2q127 _ - mutant mouse demonstrate a progressive decline in motor performance . Bonferroni _ post-hoc _ test reveal no significant difference between genotype at 4 week of age . in modeling the human sca2 phenotype , we therefore seek to recapitulate normal motor function in young animal follow by a progressive deficit with age . in this model , pc be silence as a result of excessive depolarization and consequent block of electrogenesis . point mutation in the kv1 .1 channel lead to DETECTEDPHENO ataxia type 1 -lrb- -rrb- , while mutation and triplet repeat expansion in p/q - type voltage-gated calcium channel result in ea-2 -lrb- -rrb- and in sca6 -lrb- -rrb- , respectively . b -rrb- . _ we physiological result be consistent with broad mechanism of mrna dysregulation , particularly if they result in change to ion channel protein involve in pacemaking . as mention above , reduction in voltage-gated calcium influx be find in a mouse model of ea-2 and these reduction lead to less regular ENSEMBLGENE pacemaking . interestingly , in the mouse model present here , we observe slow pacemaking , yet with little variation between the WT and mutant mouse across age . . in both 4 - and 24-week-old animal , there appear a preferential amplification of the larger band . two-way ANOVA detect a significant main effect of genotype -lrb- _ f _ = 47.21 , 20 -rrb- . in this case , a ratio be take from the intensity signal of the upper and lower band -lrb- Table -rrb- . consistent with study in sca2 patient , ao be much earlier in the atxn2q127 line than in the atxn2q58 line . finally , we look for mutually exclusive splice variant in the _ scn8a _ gene encode for transmembrane portion of the sodium channel nav1 .6 . in this study , we characterize the effect of a transgene express a full-length cdna construct with a long uninterrupted cag repeat . indeed , _ atxn2q12_7 mouse at 4 week perform similar to wild-type -lrb- wt -rrb- littermate on the accelerate rotarod -lrb- fig . -rrb- biochemical , electrophysiological and behavioral deficit worsen over the period between 8 and 40 week but pc cell loss be not apparent until 40 week . these finding be link to larger a-type potassium current and reduce glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic input . the ENSEMBLGENE firing frequency in these mouse be reduce at 5 week , a age at which rotarod performance and eyeblink conditioning be impaired but there be no sign of altered cerebellar morphology or ENSEMBLGENE loss . like the aforementioned _ cacna1b _ , both the k + channel primer set also amplify two endogenous band . significant main effect be detect for genotype -lrb- _ f _ = 54.51,107 -rrb- , age -lrb- _ f _ = 15.24,107 -rrb- and a interaction of genotype  age -lrb- _ f _ = 4.14,107 -rrb- . the author suggest that this silencing result from alteration in the kinetics of voltage-gated potassium channel . however , statistically significant difference emerge as early as 8 week -lrb- _ p _ < 0.05 -rrb- , and increase at age 12 -lrb- _ p _ < 0.001 -rrb- , 24 -lrb- _ p _ < 0.0001 -rrb- and 36 -lrb- _ p _ < 0.001 -rrb- week . thus , motor behavior be normal from birth to 4 week , show minor , but significant impairment by 8 week , which then progressively worsen over the ensue 28 week . the ratio be log transform and average follow by a two-tailed paired _ t _ - test . two-way analysis of variance -lrb- anova -rrb- determine that _ atxn2q127 _ mouse exhibit a significant age-related decrease of motor performance . no difference be statistically observe between genotype -lrb- _ p _ > 0.05 -rrb- . the maintained precision in firing will provide clue as to the type of ion channel which might be impact by the pathological process . we finding be in rough agreement with a recent study on a mouse model of sca1 engineer to express a 82 cag repeat expansion under the control of the _ pcp2 _ promoter . take together , these datum suggest a sequence of event in which concerted biochemical dysregulation lead to impairment of the basic electrophysiological function of pc and this contribute to ataxic symptom . by comparison , in _ atxn2q127 _ mouse , the mean ENSEMBLGENE firing frequency be identical to WT at 4 week but begin to decline and be significantly lower at 6 week . two gene encode for k + channel , _ kcnd3 _ and _ kcnq2 _ , also fail to indicate difference in splice variant between _ atxn2q127 _ and wt sample . two-way ANOVA reveal the main effect of genotype -lrb- _ f _ = 246.61,976 -rrb- , age -lrb- _ f _ = 10.85,976 -rrb- and genotype  age -lrb- _ f _ = 42.75,976 -rrb- . . the Bonferroni _ post-hoc _ test show that WT and _ atxnq127 _ group be not significantly different at 4 week , first become statistically different at 6 week -lrb- _ p _ = 0.015 -rrb- and remain significantly different at 8 -lrb- _ p _ = 0.000024 -rrb- , 12 , 24 and 40 week -lrb- all _ p _ < 8  10  7 -rrb- . recording be make use Axon amplifier 200b or 700b -lrb- Axon Instruments -rrb- in voltage-clamp mode . evidence suggest polyglutamine disorder exert they pathology through a toxic gain of function of the protein and larger polyq expansion have be associate with greater pathology along with a earlier ao of motor deficit , although this be subject to variability . these datum from individual pc highlight a marked slowing in the firing rate with age in the _ atxn2q127_mice . the lack of impairment in regularity be in contrast to report on mouse model of DETECTEDPHENO ataxia type 2 -lrb- ea-2 -rrb- , in which ENSEMBLGENE firing become more variable and normalization of this variability reduce ataxic behavioral symptom . the molecular layer thickness be determine use Nikon ez-c1 confocal microscope software . the firing rate decline progressively , such that at 40 week pc fire on average at  25 % the WT rate . _ cacna1a _ expression , however , be not alter in we sca2 mouse model until very late in the disease , and even then reduction do not reach significance and may have be solely due to loss of pc at that stage . mutant atxn2 protein physically interact with the ip3 receptor -lrb- ip3r1 -rrb- and lead to enhance calcium release from intracellular store upon mglur1 stimulation . _ ENSEMBLGENE _ be widely express in the mammalian nervous system . in we model , reduction of _ calb1 _ as measure by qpcr precede the onset of physiologic abnormality by 2 week and of DETECTEDPHENO abnormality by 4 week and worsen with disease progression . abnormal calcium handling in the early stage of sca2 pathogenesis may be further aggravate by reduction in _ calb1 _ expression and calbindin-28k protein level . alteration in grid2 expression have also be link to ataxic phenotype and loss of pc . furthermore , ENSEMBLGENE be a know to interact with the poly-a binding protein 1 and assemble with polyribosome , which implicate ENSEMBLGENE as be involve in the metabolism of rna . recent work have report that glutamine expansion in the c-terminal domain of the _ cacna1a _ gene , which code for the voltage-activated calcium channel cav2 .1 , may interact with _ ENSEMBLGENE _ and accelerate the ao of the disease . grid2 be localized to the pc-parallel fiber synapse and be report to be involve in the maintenance of synapse integrity , as well as long-term DETECTEDPHENO . _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , be widely express in the brain -lrb- , -rrb- ; however , DETECTEDPHENO be limit to cerebellar pc , and neuron in the brainstem and spinal cord . despite this striking reduction in firing frequency , pc maintain highly regular firing pattern as indicate by the low fraction of cell that exhibit burst and the low coefficient of variation -lrb- cv -rrb- . it be know to associate with the endoplasmic reticulum -lrb- -rrb- , the golgus complex -lrb- -rrb- and have be implicate in messenger rna -lrb- mrna -rrb- translation and transport . as early as 4 week , _ atxn2q127_animals exhibit a modest , yet statistically significant reduction in the expression of _ calb1 _ -lrb- _ p _ < 0.05 -rrb- , whereas all other gene test remain unchanged from WT -lrb- Fig . this experimental design allow comparison between the WT and transgenic animal expression within a give time point , but not across different time point . the downregulation of _ grid2 _ and _ grm1 _ early in the disease process may in itself hasten dysfunction and degeneration _ in vivo _ . dysregulation or mutation of ENSEMBLGENE may also be important in other sca . the mean firing frequency and the coefficient of variation of the ISI be indicate in each inset . spinocerebellar DETECTEDPHENO type 2 -lrb- sca2 -rrb- be one of the six cerebellar neurodegenerative disorder cause by a mutant polyglutamine -lrb- polyq -rrb- protein . mutation in the n-terminal domain of grid2 , the _ hotfoot _ allele , lead to DETECTEDPHENO of the hindlimb in mouse . . at postnatal day 1 , _ atxn2q127_and wt animal exhibit similar gene expression -lrb- datum not show -rrb- . as with the previous _ cacna1b _ assay , a _ t _ - test on log-transformed _ kcnq2 _ datum fail to detect a statistically significant difference in band intensity when compare across genotype -lrb- _ p _ > 0.05 -rrb- . by collect biochemical , electrophysiological and behavioral datum across a wide range of age , from presymptomatic to late stage , we have obtain a comprehensive picture of disease progression . importantly , grid2 be also involve in cerebellar motor coordination and learning -lrb- for review , see . these result emphasize that in this model of sca2 , physiological and behavioral phenotype precede morphological change by several week and provide a rationale for future study examine the effect of restoration of firing frequency on motor function and prevention of future loss of pc . _ calb1 : _ -lrb-

F. Maddox -rrb- . despite the close phylogenetic relationship between sheep and cattle , the few QTN previously identify in dairy cattle , , appear not to have similar effect in dairy sheep , as indicate by analysis perform in spanish Churra sheep . the allele substitution effect be higher for pp -lrb- 0.46 sd -rrb- than for fp -lrb- 0.30 sd -rrb- . genetic parameter of milk trait in Latxa dairy sheep genome-wide association -lrb- gwa -rrb- study be currently replace traditional qtl linkage mapping analysis as more powerful gene detection tool . hence , the 5 % genome-wise significance level correct for multiple testing correspond to a nominal _ p _ - value of 1.85  10  6 . additionally , 14 other chromosome-wise significant association be detect by the GWA study report herein . moreover , in sheep , the _ Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip _ have previously be use to accomplish medium-density marker genome scan to study categorical or disease-like trait and , in some case , to identify candidate causative mutation for the trait under examination . among all the dsv identify in this analysis , one of the snp locate in Exon 1 of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c -rrb- be genotype across the entire population . these two milk component be secrete independently by mammary epithelial cell . GWA analysis for milk production trait in Dairy Sheep and genetic support for a QTN Influencing milk protein percentage in the _ LALBA _ Gene however , the identification of QTN could help to avoid some important limitation of the genomic selection approach , such as the need to genotype large number of animal and repeat genotyping after several generation . in oar2 , we find significant association for three of the trait under study : my , py and fy . these igf have be suggest to be associate with milk performance in cattle . gene-assisted selection could be of special interest for apply genomic selection in sheep , in which the limited size of the population hamper the establishment of training population and the estimation of marker-qtl effect use to predict breed value . qtl influence pp and fp have previously be describe in the proximal end of oar2 in spanish churra through a microsatellite-based genome-scan , although the estimate ci from that study span most of the chromosome length . over the last five year , high-throughput snp technology have provide the opportunity to explore the genome of livestock species to identify region influence trait of economic interest . the order and name of the marker include in this haplotype be _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c , oar3_147028849 , oar3_147128672 and oar3_147275963 . in cattle , many GWA study base on snp chip have be perform so far for milk production , , , milk protein composition , milk fatty acid composition , growth , and reproductive trait . a total of 3,067 bp be sequence . among the qtl detect at the chromosome-wise significance level , two region on oar2 and oar20 show significant association for more than one trait . because lactose be the major osmoticum in milk and the process of synthesis of lactose be responsible for draw water into the milk , the reduction of this component would be expect to produce a alteration in the concentration of fat and protein . however , to date , no gwa analysis related to quantitative trait of economic interest in sheep have be report , and only the result of classical qtl analysis base on microsatellite marker be available . in dairy cattle , genomic selection be now be successfully implement base on the exist linkage disequilibrium -lrb- ld -rrb- between marker and qtl but without rely on the identification of the true causal mutation or qtn . previous study in _ ENSEMBLGENE _ - deficient mouse have show the influence of this enzyme on the protein and fat concentration in milk . in addition , the increase frequency of the favorable allele in the Churra population -lrb- _ f _ -lrb- _ lalba __ g. 242c -rrb- = 0.71 , _ f _ -lrb- _ lalba __ g. 242t -rrb- = 0.29 -rrb- and in the ram -lrb- _ f _ -lrb- _ lalba __ g. 242c -rrb- = 0.78 , _ f _ -lrb- _ lalba __ g. 242t -rrb- = 0.22 -rrb- may indicate that the Churra selection scheme , for which protein content be one of the first trait to be include as a selection target , have already affect this locus by increase the frequency of the favorable allele associate with increase milk protein content , _ lalba __ g. 242c . use the lod drop-off method , the ci cover a 4 kb-long region from 137.2 mb to 137.6 mb in oar3 . in addition to genetic analysis provide strong genetic support , identify a qtn require validation of the result in different population and functional supporting assay . genetic mapping of quantitative trait locus for milk production in sheep notably , ovine qtl for fp and for MY , FY , PY and fp have be previously identify around the ovine mhc-ii region in spanish Churra sheep and a Sarda  lacaune backcross population , respectively . accord to the Ovine Genome Assembly v2 .0 , some positional candidate gene located close to the highest association find in oar2 -lrb- 55.39 mb -rrb- , within the 48 -- 60 mb interval , be _ tgfbr1 _ -lrb- _ transform growth factor c beta receptor 1 _ -rrb- , _ igfbpl1 _ -lrb- _ insulin-like growth factor binding

transferase 1 c core 2 _ -rrb- and _ RFK _ -lrb- _ riboflavin kinase _ -rrb- . the ldlum result for fp reach chromosome-wise significance , with the maximum LRT value obtain at 134.5 mb -lrb- lrt = 84.6 ; _ p _ - value < 0.001 -rrb- . it be not a easy task to conclusively prove the identification of a QTN . among they , the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene might be consider a possible functional candidate because its code protein have a domain that resemble one find in the insulin-like growth factor binding protein -lrb- igfbp -rrb- that be bind by insulin-like growth factor -lrb- igf -rrb- . the lod-drop off ci estimate by we analysis clearly located the qtl in the first third of oar2 -lrb- 42.7 to 63.2 mb -rrb- . the number of dsv find in the sequence region be 31 , on average one polymorphism at every 98.9 bp . the result from the ldlum perform in oar3 for pp and fp be show in . the orthologous bovine region correspond to this oar2 qtl , on bta8 , have also be associate with milk py in dairy cattle . additional within-family linkage analysis show the same sign for the estimated effect of these QTL , thereby support the existence of a pleiotropic qtl that increase milk yield without affect milk composition . these observation seem to be in agreement with we finding . for pp , the most significant result be obtain at 137.3 mb -lrb- lrt = 140.2 -rrb- . another study on transgenic mouse have report that only pp be significantly affect -lrb- _ p _ - value < 0.05 -rrb- by the dilution effect due to high level of expression of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene , whereas minor difference be observe for the rest of milk component , lactose , cream -lrb- fat -rrb- , and total solid . the snp locate in the non-coding region be distribute as follow , 13 mutation be located along the gene intron , include the two indel , whereas eight snp be find in the promoter and nine other snp in the 3  utr , respectively . accord to the significance threshold set through simulation -lrb- lrt = 78.5 for a chromosome-wise _ p _ - value of 0.0001 -rrb- , the analysis reveal a highly significant qtl located in the middle of a haplotype of 4 snp that include the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene . this mutation be predict to cause a amino acid substitution of valine to alanine at position 27 of the protein sequence -lrb- val27alum -rrb- . the sequencing analysis be perform on the 16 ram for the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene , include all exon , intron , the promoter region and 3  utr of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene . significance threshold for the gwa analysis be estimate use a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing . the central part of oar20 exhibit significant association with more than one trait , although there be also single point association . ab052168 -rrb- . at position 23.7 mb , there be one marker significantly associate with fy , whereas in the region between 29.1 and 29.6 mb , chromosome-wise significant association be detect for pp and fp . two of the polymorphism be one-base indel mutation , and 29 be single-base substitution . on this regard , it should be take into account that in dairy sheep , milk fp show , in general , a lower heritability than milk pp . only one of the snp identify be located within a translate region of the gene , in Exon 1 -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c ; genbank Accession No . the second most significantly associate snp for both pp and fp be also located in the intronic region of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene that be identify as the top snp in the initial gwa analysis , oar3_147028849 . in any case , the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c genetic variant appear to be a useful marker for take advantage of the commercial nature of the population that have serve to identify this potential and could be directly use to assist Churra sheep breeder to make informed decision base on genomic information . a summary of the significant snp associate with the study trait be present in . as not all of the marker test for association be independent because of ld , the Bonferroni correction for the total number of marker in the study be conservative . these result confirm the population-level segregation of a previously report qtl affect pp and suggest that this qtl have a significant pleiotropic effect on fp . a summary of the discover experiment - and chromosome-wise significant association be present in . in general , most of the chromosome-wise significant result be single-point associate snp with the exception of a 20-mb long region on oar2 , which show significant association with the three `` yield '' trait -lrb- my , py and fy -rrb- . sequencing this gene in the 16 Churra ram of the study resource population identify additional polymorphism . one out of the 31 polymorphism identify be located within the coding gene sequence -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c -rrb- and be predict to cause a amino acid change in the protein -lrb- val27alum -rrb- . we result strongly support the polymorphism _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c as the most likely causal mutation of the study oar3 qtl affect pp and fp , although we can not rule out the possibility that this snp be in perfect linkage disequilibrium with the true causal polymorphism . snp on 14 chromosome show significant association with the study trait at the 5 % chromosome-wise level . significant result for fp cover a narrower region -lrb- 4.3 mb ; from 133.0 to 137.3 mb -rrb- than for pp . the study population consist of a total of 1,681 Churra ewe belong to 16 half-sib family with available record for milk yield -lrb- my -rrb- , milk protein and fat yield -lrb- py and fy -rrb- and milk protein and fat contents -lrb- pp and fp -rrb- . in this work , we have demonstrate that the _ lalba __ g. 242t > c mutation fulfil , for the pp trait , several of the genetic support-related condition detail in that list : -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be in the define ci by linkage and linkage disequilibrium mapping ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the gene function be relate to the trait ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- there be concordance between the genotype and the qtl status in the segregate sire -lrb- however , this concordance be not observe for the fp trait -rrb- ; -lrb- 4 -rrb- the allele frequency of the allele with favorable effect be higher , possibly because of intensive directional selection , and -lrb- 5 -rrb- the detect effect disappear when we fix the candidate snp genotype in the linear mixed model equation . depict Manhattan plot across the whole genome for the five analyze trait , with snp association represent as log -lrb- 1 / _ p _ - value -rrb- on the y-axis . the most significant result from the gwa analysis be obtain for pp on oar3 . this study be , to we knowledge , the first report GWA study for milk production trait in sheep use a high-throughput snp array . on the basis of these observation , the high phenotypic correlation between milk content trait -lrb- r2 = 0.49 , base on we yd value -rrb- and the significance observe for the pp related qtl , we presume that the target qtl primarily affect pp , with a secondary pleiotropic effect on fp , as previously suggest by . another potential functional candidate identify for the chromosome-wise significant association be find for the fy associate oar25 peak , which be located in the region surround the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene -lrb- _ neuregulin 3 _ -rrb- . different approach , include GWA analysis , a combined linkage and linkage disequilibrium study and a concordance test with the QTL segregate status of the sire , be utilize to assess the role of this mutation as a putative qtn for the genetic effect detect on oar3 . further association be detect at the chromosome-wise significance level on 14 other chromosomal region . homozygous mutant mouse produce highly viscous milk that be very rich in fat and protein and devoid of alpha-lactalbumin and lactose . the LRT for fp at the location of the pp qtl -lrb- 137.2 mb -rrb- , i.e. , the location of lalba gene , be 76.7 -lrb- _ p _ - value < 0.001 -rrb- . the rest of the chromosome-wise significant association report in this paper be , in general , determine by a single , isolate snp . in livestock species , gwa analysis have become a powerful strategy to identify dsv affect phenotypic variation . in the initial GWA scan for the pp trait , the marker s19950 rank 9th among the most significant marker -lrb- _ p _ - value = 1.3  10  9 -rrb- . the remain nine sire of the population be homozygous for the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242c allele . the inclusion of this snp as fixed effect in the model nonetheless yield highly significant result on oar3 for both pp -lrb- _ p _ - value = 3.35  10  22 -rrb- and fp -lrb- _ p _ - value = 8.94  10  9 -rrb- . we assign each of the sire 's phase to the _ Q _ or _ q _ allele of the qtl accord to the daughter 's ibd and the qtl effect . take into account allelic frequency at the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c locus in the Churra ewe population -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242c allele = 0.71 and _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t allele = 0.29 -rrb- , the probability of this concordance by chance be estimate to be 0.0087 . on the basis of the marker allelic frequency , the probability of the concordance by chance be 0.0155 . finally , the 5 % experiment-wise significance threshold be set by account for the three independent trait analyze , which be determine by a principal component analysis perform in r -lrb- r development core Team , 2008 -rrb- . the marker on oar3 show the highest significant association be located at the third intron of the _ alpha-lactalbumin -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- _ gene , which be a functional and positional candidate underlie this association . the ovine _ ENSEMBLGENE _ mrna sequence report by -lrb- genbank nm001009797 -rrb- show three nucleotide variant regard the gene sequence use as reference here -lrb- genbank ab052168 -rrb- , one of which correspond to the code mutation identify in we population , _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > C. however , to we knowledge , there be no reported study on the influence of the ovine _ ENSEMBLGENE _ polymorphism on milk trait . for simplicity , the statistical significance value give in the text refer to nominal _ p - _ value . the sequence analysis of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene in we resource population identify 31 dsv , one of which be located in the gene-coding region -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c -rrb- , and identify a non-synonymous mutation cause a val27alum substitution . on the basis of these result , we postulate that the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t allele be the ancestral variant at that position , whereas the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242c allele appear to be a more recent mutation , potentially favor by classical selection in Churra sheep because of its favorable effect on milk protein content . to predict the possible structural change that this amino acid change could cause in the ENSEMBLGENE protein , we use the software polyphen . the most significant association identify reach experiment-wise significance for pp and fp and be locate on chromosome 3 -lrb- oar3 -rrb- . complete nucleotide sequence of ovine alpha-lactalbumin mrna the role of bovine causal gene underlie dairy trait in spanish Churra sheep polymorphism in the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene be study in the 1990s as possible marker relate to milk production in dairy species . in this study , we use the _ Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip _ to conduct a genome-wide association -lrb- gwa -rrb- analysis for milk production trait in dairy sheep by analyze a commercial population of spanish Churra sheep . the concordance analysis be also perform for fp . additionally , among the sire that do not reach statistical significance to be consider segregate , there be four sire heterozygous for the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c mutation , all of which share a _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242c allele at the parental haplotype associate with increase pp . follow , we perform a fixed position analysis at the closest position to the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene -lrb- 137 mb -rrb- . two of they be coincident with the pp segregate sire , whereas the third , which be homozygous for the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c polymorphism , be not segregate for the pp qtl . the analysis be perform at every 0.1 cm . this polymorphism be one of the snp identify in we population -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 82g > a -rrb- , but it be homozygous for all the three sire segregate for the oar3 qtl in we study . three sire segregate for the fp qtl at the _ LALBA _ gene -lrb- ab -lrb- t -rrb- > 1.96 -rrb- . in cattle , one snp located in the promoter of this gene -lrb- ulgr_snp_u63109_1966 -rrb- have be find to influence milk trait . this GWA study identify marker oar3_147028849 , located in the third intron of this gene , as the snp with the most highly significant association detect on oar3 for pp and fp . within the haplotype block interval consider , from 136.8 to 138.1 mb , there be another polymorphism , s19950 , which show concordance with the qtl status in the three segregate sire . the significance threshold be estimate through a total of 1,000 simulation . all three sire ' phase carry the _ Q _ allele share the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242c allele . to assess the possible causality of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene , all snp map on oar3 be phase for the entire population use the phasebook software , follow the protocol describe by . the same region of oar3 also show a experiment-wise significant association with fp -lrb- _ p - _ value = 1.8  10  10 -rrb- , in which marker oar3_147028849 be also identify as the top snp for this trait . the allelic substitution effect of this snp be positive for both trait , although the magnitude be larger for pp -lrb- 0.47 sd -rrb- than for fp -lrb- 0.30 sd -rrb- . the objective of this study be , first , to identify , at the population level , novel region associate with milk production trait that have not previously be identify because of the lower resolution of microsatellite-based scan and/or the limitation of outbreed linkage-based study and , second , to replicate and fine-map qtl previously identify in Churra sheep . the snp show the most significant association be oar3_147028849 -lrb- _ p - _ value = 3.78  10  26 -rrb- , which be located in the third intron of the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene . significant association be also remove when marker oar3_147028849 be fix in the fp analysis . significant snp in this linkage group be concentrate between 42.7 and 63.2 mb , although most of they be located in the middle of that region , between 53.0 and 58.0 mb . the dependent variable use in the association analysis be the yield deviation -lrb- yd -rrb- correspond to the study trait . these chromosome be oar1 , oar2 , oar3 , oar4 , oar6 , oar7 , oar12 , oar14 , oar15 , oar16 , oar17 , oar20 , oar23 and oar25 . moreover , there be a need to confirm whether the same physiological mechanism explain the effect detect on pp and fp , and why some of we analysis be not as conclusive for the fp trait as they be for the pp trait . support for the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t allele as the ancestral be also indicate by the large haplotype block share by the _ Q _ - carry chromosome compare to the discontinuous haplotype block of the _ q _ - carry chromosome , as show in . although some of these isolate association could be spurious result or inaccurate chromosomal location mapping result from the draft stage of the ovine assembly , it be also possible that they indicate genuine genotype-phenotype association that would require a more powerful design to be identify . the significantly associate snp cover a 10.5 mb-long region of the chromosome -lrb- from 130.0 to 140.5 mb -rrb- , but the highest lrt value -lrb- _ p - _ value < 1.0  10  10 -rrb- be obtain within a 30 kb interval -lrb- from 137.29 to 137.32 mb -rrb- . to test the ability of these two snp to explain variance in the study trait , we individually include they in the mixed model equation as fixed factor . this genotyping be perform by kbioscience use the fluorescence-based competitive allele-specific pcr -lrb- kaspar -rrb- assay -lrb- for detail , see . the yd be estimate as average of the ewe ' raw phenotypic record correct for fixed environmental effect and the common environmental effect . here , we present the significant association identify through the gwa analysis for the five milk production trait include in the study -lrb- my , pp , fp , py and fy -rrb- . therefore , base on the method describe by , we calculate the number of independently analyze marker test for each chromosome and for the entire genome . this mutation would be the first ovine-proposed qtn in relation to milk production trait . other point list by , include the need to confirm the concordance of the result in additional sheep population and the performance of functional assay complement by physiological datum will be require to finally prove the causality suggest herein for the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c mutation . the sign of the allelic substitution effect at the peak qtl position be identical for pp , fp , py and fy , with slightly higher estimate -lrb- in sd unit -rrb- for the protein quantity trait than for the fat trait -lrb- datum not show -rrb- , whereas the calculated effect for my be small and negative -lrb- -0.05 sd -rrb- . in they review , provide a list of condition for a candidate mutation to meet the burden of proof for QTN and discard possible false positive or neutral polymorphism in near perfect ld with the causative mutation . when we fix marker _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c in the analysis , the significant association previously identify on oar3 for pp and fp disappear . the calculation of the yd be perform use multivariate animal repeatability model . for the whole genome , the total number of independent snp analyze be 26,965 . blood sample from 1,696 spanish Churra ewe be collect in order to extract dna . when examine whether the mutation be located in a conserve region of the protein across species , we observe that at the corresponding amino acid position , ruminant and mouse have a valine residue , correspond to the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t allele , whereas other species , such as human , horse , pig and macaque , have a leucine . hence , it be possible that the lower heritability for this trait indicate that there be additional non-genetic factor that be not be control in the yd estimation model . this latter snp be located 23 kb upstream from _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene . in the present work , the _ Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip _ be use to perform a higher density gwa analysis to identify genomic region influence milk production trait in Churra sheep . however , when this marker be fix in the pp mixed model equation significant effect for marker _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c and oar3_146832060 still remain -lrb- p value = 3.17  10  7 and 1.85  10  6 , respectively -rrb- . the next amino acid of the protein sequence , phe28ser , also show this divergence pattern between species . the LA perform at the fix position of 137 mb , the closest position to the _ LALBA _ gene , show that three of the sire be segregate for the qtl -lrb- ab -lrb- t -rrb- > 1.96 -rrb- . the candidacy initially suggest by for the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene be strongly support by the GWA study report here . the result indicate that the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c mutation do not lead to any structural change in the protein . the result of the different analysis present here for the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c snp , include the highly significant association , the cancelation of the qtl effect when it be include as fixed effect in the linear mixed model , and the concordance test , provide strong statistical support that this snp be the most explanatory qtn accounting for the milk protein and fat content qtl detect in oar3 in spanish Churra sheep . use the information provide by the QTLMap LDLA approach , we examine the estimate haplotype effect for pp at the maximum LRT position . moreover , the secondary structure for the protein sequence be identical at the mutation region independent of the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c allele . the phenotype include in the analysis be milk yield -lrb- my -rrb- , protein yield -lrb- py -rrb- , fat yield -lrb- fy -rrb- , protein percentage -lrb- pp -rrb- and fat percentage -lrb- fp -rrb- , which be collect routinely by the National Association of Churra Breeders -lrb- ANCHE -rrb- through the official milk record process . the ewe be distribute in 16 half-sib family with a average size of 105 daughter per ram -lrb- range from 29 to 277 animal per half-sib family -rrb- . the fixed effect use to calculate these yd be the herd-test-day effect , the birth order , the age of the ewe at parturition -lrb- as a covariate nested within birth order -rrb- , the number of bear lamb and the number of week of milk production of the ewe . sequence analysis be perform for the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene , which be identify as a strong candidate gene for the most significant association identify in this study . the use of animal be perform in compliance with the guideline approve by the University of Leon ethical commission . we observe that all haplotype with a positive effect on pp be carry the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242c allele at the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c locus , whereas all haplotype contain the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t allele at that position show a negative haplotype effect on pp . for the chromosome show the most significant association in this study , oar3 , we perform a combined ldlum with the aim of refine the ci of the pp qtl detect on that chromosome . descriptive datum for the snp chip , include the number of snp per chromosome , the distance between they , the average ENSEMBLGENE and heterozygosity and ld calculation , have be previously report by . six primer pair be design for the sequence analysis of this gene in the 16 ram of the study resource population base on the available reference sequence -lrb- genbank Accession No . the association analysis be repeat for oar3 incorporate the genotype snp located in the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ exon , _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c , and the result for pp and fp be present in . this qtl be locate on chromosome 3 -lrb- oar3 -rrb- and influence milk protein percentage . after a initial increase of microsatellite marker density , some candidate gene , such as _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- _ histone deacetylase 7 _ -rrb- , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- _ vitamin d receptor _ -rrb- , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- _ insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 _ -rrb- and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- _ alpha-lactalbumin _ -rrb- , be identify within the redefine 13-cm length confidence interval -lrb- ci -rrb- estimate for this qtl region . in spanish Churra sheep , only one of the qtl identify for milk trait reach genome-wide significance . in dairy sheep , microsatellite-based whole genome-scan have identify several qtl influence milk-related trait . for both of the trait , the snp _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c show the most significant association -lrb- _ p - _ value for pp _ = _ 2.34  10  30 ; _ p _ - value for fp = 1.62  10  12 -rrb- . the concordance test perform use the phase estimate with phasebook show that the three sire find to be segregate for the qtl in the LA be heterozygous at the _ ENSEMBLGENE __ g. 242t > c locus but not at the oar3_147028849 snp . for the mutation show concordance with the sire ' qtl status , we then estimate the probability of concordance by chance between the qtl status and the snp genotype . the implementation in other dairy sheep population will depend on the frequency of the variant , the rate of ld with the causal mutation , and the validation of the report association . this probability be calculate as _ pa -lrb- nq -rrb- x pb -lrb- nq -rrb- _ , where _ pa _ and _ pb _ be the allele frequency of the snp associate with _ Q _ and _ q _ qtl allele , respectively , and _ nq _ and _ nq _ be the number of concordant _ Q _ and _ q _ chromosome . after the qc perform on the raw genotype , a total of 43,784 snp distribute on the 26 ovine autosome be include in the gwa analysis . this region on oar6 have be previously suggest to be associate with milk composition trait in sheep . follow the sequencing protocol describe by , we obtain the forward and reverse strand sequence of the complete _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene -lrb- 4 exon and 3 intron ; 1,741 bp -rrb- , a fraction of the promoter -lrb- 656 bp -rrb- and the 3  utr region -lrb- 670 bp -rrb- -lrb- see for the primer sequence and the amplification annealing temperature for each amplicon -rrb- . for this purpose , all of the marker on this chromosome from the _ Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip _ and the commercially genotype _ ENSEMBLGENE _ snp be use to perform a ldlum use the qtlmap software . the two phase of the segregate sire be assign to one of the qtl allele -lrb- _ Q _ and _ q _ -rrb- accord to the sign of the estimated effect for the sire and the daughter 's ibd status as obtain from gridqtl . this latter hypothesis be support , for example , by the observation that the snp associate with pp at the distal region of oar6 -lrb- du430803_572 , 85.44 mb -rrb- be located within the casein gene cluster -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ , _ csn1s2 _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- , which encode the major protein in sheep milk that determine the technological property of milk during cheese manufacturing . dna sequence variant -lrb- dsv -rrb- in the 16 Churra ram ' sequence be identify use the SeqScape v2 .5 software -lrb- Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA -rrb- . to identify the heterozygous sire for the oar3 qtl , we perform a classical regression-based linkage analysis -lrb- LA -rrb- for the oar3 marker include in the interval 70 -- 200 mb use the software gridqtl . ab052168 ; . the family show a significant qtl effect estimate at the 5 % nominal level -lrb- ab -lrb- t -rrb- > 1.96 -rrb- be consider to be heterozygous -lrb- _ qq _ -rrb- at the QTL . to estimate the ci , the likelihood ratio test statistic -lrb- lrt -rrb- value be convert into lod score , and the LOD drop-off method , as describe in , be use . the most significant association identify by we gwa analysis have previously be

/ intra-species comparative and phylogenetic analysis of _ cmf , COL _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene family indicate they evolve prior to the monocot/dicot divergence  200 mya , with Poaceae _ CMF _ evolution describe as the interplay between whole genome duplication in the ancestral cereal , and subsequent clade-specific mutation , deletion and duplication event . while _ ghd7 _ orthologue -lrb- Poaceae _ cmf8 _ gene -rrb- be present in all three tropical sd species investigate , they be not find in either of the two temperate ld cereal investigate -lrb- barley and brachypodium -rrb- . genetic mapping be conduct use JoinMap v3 .0 . sequence trace be manipulate use VectorNTI . the role of cct domain gene in the control of flowering be well document . thus , absence of _ ghd7 _ orthologue in temperate cereal could be explain by they mutation/deletion after the split of temperate and tropical cereal lineage . sequencing in parental line use a minimum of three independent pcr as template for sequencing use BigDye kit v3 .1 -lrb- Applied Biosystems -rrb- , follow the protocol describe by . _ cmf _ gene be identify in rice and arabidopsis -lrb- tair annotation release 10 of the _ a. thaliana _ genome , release 9 -rrb- by ENSEMBLGENE analysis of cd from _ osh , OsI _ and arabidopsis homologue . however , to avoid DETECTEDPHENO , the reclassification of _ hvco9 _ as _ cmf11 _ -lrb- due to lack of b-box -rrb- have mean we have have to miss out _ co9 _ in the otherwise consecutive order of Poaceae _ CO _ gene identify here . this hypothesis be support by clustering of Poaceae paralogue within each of the five phylogenetic clade , as well as region of conservation throughout they protein . all gene synonym be list in . the Triticeae _ ZCCT _ gene , along with _ ghd7 _ and cereal orthologue of the rice gene _ OsH _ form a distinct group within the _ COL _ gene . heritable basis for some genotype-environment stability statistics : inference from qtl analysis of head date in two-rowed barley unless otherwise state , primary transcript be use throughout . four _ CMF _ gene pair appear to have evolve as a result of the ancestral wgd -lrb- _ cmf1 -- 5 , cmf3 -- 7 , cmf4 -- 10 , cmf12 -- 13 _ -rrb- . molecular mapping of major gene and quantitative locus determine flowering time in response to photoperiod in barley the significance of this evolutionary trend in Clade 1 be highlight by the occurrence of b-box degradation/elimination in two of the three know Poaceae CCT domain flowering time gene , affect floral response to vernalization in cereal -lrb- _ zcct1 _ orthologue -rrb- and to ld photoperiod in rice -lrb- _ ghd7/osi _ -rrb- . the update Poaceae _ COL _ nomenclature present here build on the numerical numbering system previously introduce for brachypodium , sorghum and barley in these species . towards understand the evolution of Poaceae CCT domain gene , we then determine the _ cmf , col , ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ zcct _ gene family in the sequence genome of rice , brachypodium , sorghum , foxtail millet , as well as in the preliminary draft barley genome . two fl-cdna sequence with high homology to _ oscmf6 _ be identify , and be name _ hvcmf6a _ -lrb- ak250075 -rrb- and _ hvcmf6b _ -lrb- ak355694 -rrb- . with the recognition of the _ cmf _ gene family , the rice _ COL _ gene family should be reduce from sixteen -lrb- _ osa-osp _ -rrb- to fourteen member , due to the lack of b-box domain in _ osh _ and _ ghd7 _ -lrb- _ osus _ -rrb- . recessive mutant allele at colinear cereal _ vrn-2 _ genetic locus abolish vernalization response , result in spring-sown crop ideotype that allow flexibility of cultivation and adaptation to new agricultural environment . the first to be identify be the _ ZCCT _ gene that underlie colinear _ vrn-2 _ vernalization response locus in temperate cereal . activation of a gene for a protein with novel class of cct-domain activate expression of a subset of sugar-inducible gene in _ Arabidopsis thaliana _ Inter - and intra-species comparative analysis show that the _ cmf , COL _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene family consist largely of array of paralogous gene-pair located at colinear genomic location across the Poaceae that evolve from common ancestor prior to WGD in the ancestral grass genome . _ cmf , COL _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene family be determine in the current rice genome assembly -lrb- _ oryza sativa _ ssp . all but two of these -lrb- _ hvcmf1 _ and _ hvcmf3 _ -rrb- be predict to encode full length transcript . for the _ COL _ family , code region -lrb- cd -rrb- for each of the fourteen known rice gene be use as query , while for the _ ENSEMBLGENE _ family , cd of the five gene list by be use . finally , previous study show that while the rice paralogue of _ osh _ -lrb- chromosome os10 -rrb- have be lose on chromosome os03 after whole genome duplication -lrb- wgd -rrb- in the ancestral cereal genome , the paralogous gene have be retain on the long arm of the temperate cereal group 4 chromosome . barley _ cmf _ gene be identify for nine of the thirteen rice member -lrb- _ hvcmf1 , hvcmf3-hvcmf7 , hvcmf10 -- 11 , hvcmf13 _ -rrb- , with no barley homologue of _ oscmf2 , oscmf8 , oscmf9 , oscmf12 _ and _ oscmf14 _ identify . to explore gene family structure and evolution in more detail , protein sequence immediately adjacent to intron bisect cct domain be align , resolve four major group . alignment of cct domain from Poaceae CMF , COL , ENSEMBLGENE and ZCCT cct protein investigate in subsequent phylogenetic analysis , find perfect amino acid conservation at four position : tyr23-arg26-ala30-arg35 . all Poaceae col protein identify here possess protein domain configuration identical to they closest rice homologue . in barley , three cosegregating copy of the ancestral paralogue -lrb- _ zcct-ha , zcct-hb _ and _ zcct -- hc _ -rrb- be present in vernalization sensitive variety . as expect , blastn analysis of the vernalization insensitive barley variety ` Morex ' and ` Haruna Nijo ' do not return any z_cct-h _ gene . col protein possess either one or two b-box , in addition to a cct domain . however , dispersed region of conservation be evident between smaller sub-group of cmf protein . accordingly , previously publish sequence identify in vernalization sensitive line be use in subsequent molecular and phylogenetic analysis . in addition , gly38 be conserve in the protein of all but one -lrb- _ hvcmf3 _ -rrb- of the poaceae gene investigate . in all but three _ cmf _ gene -lrb- _ oscmf4 , oscmf10 , oscmf11 _ -rrb- , the cct domain be encode within region span the penultimate and last exon . intronic snp t505/c allow _ hvcmf7 _ to be map to 114.6 cm , on the long arm of 7h . Group 3 have a intron located after residue 22 , and consist exclusively of Poaceae and arabidopsis _ CMF _ gene -lrb- _ cmf1 , cmf4-cmf6 , cmf10 , cmf12-cmf14 _ -rrb- . moss within the streptophyte lineage such as the ancestor of _ P. paten _ separate from the cormophyte  500 mya , with the cormophyte lineage -lrb- to which the ancestor of the spikemoss _ selaginellum moellendorffius _ belong -rrb- diverge from seed plant  400 mya . thus , parsimonious analysis indicate the _ CMF _ family may have evolve from _ col _ gene after the divergence of the cormophyte and streptophyte lineage , around 500  400 mya . three of the four _ ZCCT _ gene investigate -lrb- _ zcct1 , zcct-ha , zcct-hb _ -rrb- be predict to encode zinc-finger domain towards the n-terminus , as previously report , , which show some similarity to the conserve c and h residue of col b-box1 . the ancestral cereal be hypothesise to have be a sd plant of tropical environment . all three novel _ oscol _ gene be predict to possess one b-box domain , located towards the n-terminus of they predict protein . characteristic region of sequence conservation outside the identify protein domain within and between gene family indicate a hierarchy of evolutionary relatedness result from genetic mutation follow process such as wgd , inter-species hybridization event and localized gene duplication or deletion over they evolutionary history . here , combined phylogenetic , molecular and comparative analysis identify predominantly distinct _ cmf , COL _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene family in arabidopsis and the Poaceae , show they predate the monocot/dicot divergence  200 million year ago -lrb- mya -rrb- . genomic dna be extract from leaf material use the dneasy 96 plant kit -lrb- qiagen -rrb- . to determine _ COL _ copy number in the current rice genome assembly , we use _ oscol _ cd for blastn analysis . morex -lrb- generate by the International Barley sequencing Consortium , available at -rrb- or fl-cdna . phylogenetic analysis be conduct on the result alignment use the phylip package v3 .5 . as well as lack homologue of _ osb _ and _ osq _ , both species possess a single additional _ col _ gene -lrb- _ sbco20 _ and _ sico20 _ -rrb- , absent in the temperate grass investigate here . the three novel rice col protein -lrb- _ osr-oss _ -rrb- and they Poaceae homologue all possess a single b-box , while sbco20/sico20 and bdco2 homologue in sorghum and foxtail millet contain two b-box . the _ Arabidopsis _ e3 Ubiquitin Lingase hos1 negatively regulate CONSTANS abundance in the photoperiodic control of flowering the result removal of ld floral delay would allow growth and reproduction in the warm ld condition of temperate summer . the first contain _ COL _ Group I gene from arabidopsis and the grass , while the second contain _ CMF _ and _ zcct _ gene , unique to the Poaceae . cct domain possess region of amino acid conservation with heme activator protein2 -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- , a component of the ha2/hap3/hap5 protein complex that bind to promoter ccaat dna motif in eukaryotic gene , and modify they transcription . take such datum into account , _ cmf _ gene family be likely to encode transcription factor that modify floral gene expression through dna-binding or dna-binding complex , mediate by the CCT motif . the first contain protein with a intron after CCT residue 15 , and be compose predominantly of _ col _ gene -lrb- homologue of rice gene _ osm-oss _ -rrb- , along with four _ cmf _ gene -lrb- _ oscmf2 , sicmf2 , atcmf2 , atcmf5 _ -rrb- . the second group possess a intron after residue 20 , and contain Poaceae _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene -lrb- exclude _ toc1 _ homologue , which lack a cct domain intron -rrb- , as well as _ atcmf7 _ . additionally , phylogenetic and protein/gene structure analysis indicate evolutionary relatedness between group of _ COL _ and _ cmf _ gene prior to monocot/dicot divergence . exon number for homologous gene commonly vary between species , although nine _ COL _ -lrb- homologue of rice gene _ osa,osc-osd , osg,osj-osn _ -rrb- , three _ cmf _ -lrb- _ cmf1 , cmf5 , cmf11 _ -rrb- and three _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -lrb- _ prr59 , prr73 , toc1 _ -rrb- gene share identical number in all four of the sequence Poaceae species investigate . the remain _ cmf _ gene be distribute between phylogenetic clade 4 and 1 . genetic mapping of the ten barley _ cmf _ gene identify , as well as twelve previously unmapped _ hvcol _ and _ hvprr _ gene , find the majority map to colinear position relative to they Poaceae orthologue . exclude the cct domain , Poaceae cmf protein do not share additional common conserve region , nor be further protein domain identify . similarly , the final group exclusively contain _ cmf _ gene from the Poaceae -lrb- _ cmf3 , cmf7 , cmf9 _ -rrb- and arabidopsis _ cmf _ -lrb- _ atcmf3 , atcmf9 , atcmf11 , atcmf14 _ -rrb- , which all possess a intron after residue 37 . while the former consist exclusively of arabidopsis and Poaceae _ CMF _ gene with a conserve cct domain intron , the latter contain sub-branch possess _ col , CMF _ and _ zcct _ gene -lrb- discuss subsequently -rrb- . indeed , independent mutation at three of these conserve residue have be show to result in novel allele in several plant species , , , , -lrb- -rrb- , recently , the cct domain of arabidopsis co have be show to mediate protein-protein interaction with the e3 ubiquitin ligase ENSEMBLGENE and hos1 -- , both of which regulate co stability . preliminary investigation in rice show that such gene be relatively common , with thirteen member -lrb- include _ osh _ and _ ghd7 _ -rrb- identifiable in the current genome assembly . all gene family investigate possess a cct domain in they predict protein , with greater amino acid conservation towards the c-terminus . the control of flowering time be a crucial environmental adaptation in plant , as well as a major determinant of grain yield in cereal crop . these highly conserve cct/hap2 residue be likely site for point mutation result in altered function in CMF , COL and ENSEMBLGENE protein . give the proven role of _ cmf _ gene in the modulation of cereal flowering , the molecular , phylogenetic and comparative analysis of the Poaceae _ CMF , COL _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene family present here provide the foundation from which functional investigation can be undertake . thus , while analysis of _ COL _ or _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene and gene family have be previously undertake to vary extent in barley , rice , sorghum and brachypodium , -- , comprehensive analysis of all cct domain gene family know to possess member that regulate flowering in the Poaceae , and specifically the largely unrecognised _ cmf _ gene family , be yet to be undertake in the grass . we molecularly describe the _ cmf _ -lrb- and related _ col _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- gene family in four sequence Poaceae species , as well as in the draft genome assembly of barley -lrb- _ hordeum vulgare _ -rrb- . this class of rice gene have previously be term the _ COL _ Group III gene family -lrb- _ osm-osp _ -rrb- , and also include the three additional Poaceae _ COL _ gene identify in this study -lrb- homologous to rice gene _ osq-oss _ -rrb- . _ hvcmf6b _ be find to cosegregate with _ hvcmf6a _ , use a presence -lrb- owb-d -rrb- / absence -lrb- owb-r -rrb- polymorphism . they belong to the _ constan _ - like -lrb- _ col _ -rrb- and _ preudoresponse regulator _ -lrb- _ ENSEMBLGENE _ -rrb- gene family , which in addition to a cct domain possess b-box or response-regulator domain , respectively . the presence of chimeric b-box in orthologous poacea gene show that truncation occur prior to the divergence of the grass , around 60 mya . two example of poaceae-specific b-box degradation be evident . common ancestry be demonstrate for four clade 1 paralogous gene-pair , which evolve as a result of ancestral cereal wgd -lrb- _ col _ gene orthologous to _ osa-osu _ , _ osc-osd , ose-osf _ and _ cmf11-zcct _ -rrb- . it have be suggest that _ col _ gene evolution be lead to protein encode just one b-box domain . for clarity when compare orthologous genetic locus and gene , we use the vernalization locus nomenclature describe by , and _ zcct1 _ -lrb- also call _ vrn2 _ -rrb- to denote the gene underlie the _ vrn-am2 _ locus in _ T. monococcum _ . _ col _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene be present in the moss _ physcomitrellum patens _ , with ENSEMBLGENE search show _ cmf _ gene to be absent . previously map _ COL , ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ zcct _ gene , , be integrate into the barley consensus map base on common marker and establish inter-specific barley-rice colinearity . interestingly , no _ zcct _ gene be present at the colinear region of the sd tropical plant rice , or in the sequence rapid cycling accession of brachypodium . search in barley identify five _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene , include the barley _ osprr37 _ orthologue that encode the photoperiod locus _ ppd-h1 _ . five _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene be identify in the genome of rice and brachypodium -lrb- -rrb- , agree with previous report . interestingly , clade 1 contain the greatest number of protein domain configuration , include protein encode _ COL _ gene with two b-box , or chimeric b-box1 / b-box2 domain , as well as _ cmf _ and _ zcct _ gene . environmentally robust flowering time qtl towards the telomeric region of chromosome 1bl and 1dl have be identify in three additional hexaploid wheat mapping population , lead to the classification of these genomic region as flowering time meta-qtl , putatively control by homeoallele . similarly , five _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene be find in foxtail millet -lrb- chromosome si1 -- 2 , si8 -- 9 -rrb- and sorghum -lrb- chromosome ENSEMBLGENE -- 2 , sb4 -- 6 -rrb- . three of the remain four _ hvprr _ gene be predict to encode full length cd , while lack of available genomic sequence correspond to _ hvprr59 _ mean that the result predict protein be truncate upstream of exon 2 . no barley homologue be identify for _ osq _ and _ oss _ . _ De novo _ gene prediction and reassessment be conduct use fgenesh -lrb- -rrb- use ` monocot ' as the basis of gene prediction . base on known flowering time gene in model species , no additional candidate gene be identify in this region of rice chromosome os05 -lrb- 29.00 -- 29.95 mbp -rrb- . three of the foxtail millet _ col _ gene -lrb- _ sico1 , sico5 _ and _ sico19 _ -rrb- be identify by gene prediction reanalysis of genomic region identify by blastn analysis . unrooted phylogeny be determine use the distance matrix method , with tree topography support by bootstrapping -lrb- 1,000 replicate -rrb- . barley _ osl-osn _ homologue be identify on genomic contig of size 4,069 -- 6,808 bp , with gene prediction software identify just one gene per contig . in addition to the previously identify barley orthologue of _ osa _ -lrb- _ hvco1 _ -rrb- , _ osb-osg _ -lrb- _ hvco3-hvco8 _ -rrb- and _ bdco2 _ -lrb- _ hvco2 _ -rrb- , , search of the preliminary draft barley genome and full length -lrb- fl -rrb- cdna identify eight additional full-length _ col _ gene homologous to _ osj-osp _ and _ osr _ . pcr cycling be carry out use a Veriti 96 well Thermo Cycler Thermocycler -lrb- Applied Biosystems -rrb- with the parameter : 5 min at 96  c , follow by 35 cycle of 50 sec at 96  c , 50 sec annealing temperature , 90 sec at 72  c , final extension of 7 min at 72  C. Annealing temperature be list in . closer inspection find a sequencing gap span predict _ sbprr95 _ exon 6 and part of exon 7 , indicate complete sequencing would resolve a _ sbprr95 _ gene model . remain _ hvcol _ gene be identify from fl-cdna sequence . microcolinearity between orthologous Poaceae _ CMF _ gene be determine use  10 gene on each side of each _ oscmf _ gene for BLASTn query of the sequence genome of brachypodium , sorghum and foxtail millet , use the ENSEMBLGENE parameter list above . the trend of degradation or complete loss of b-box domain within Clade 1 appear to have result in the evolution of cct domain gene lack b-box within the poaceae-specific _ cmf/zcct _ sub-branch . colinearity between rice -lrb- mbp -rrb- and the barley consensus genetic map -lrb- cm -rrb- be determine as describe by . the 1h qtl peak be associate with marker abg387a and 11_20840 , orthologous to os05g51530 and os05g51450 , respectively . furthermore , qtl for related morphological trait include final leaf number and grain yield be also find at this location -lrb- 154 -- 158 cm , between marker 11_11509 and 11_20840 -rrb- . pcr amplification be carry out in 10 l reaction use the reagent ship in the FastStart _ taq _ dna polymerase kit -lrb- Roche -rrb- . genetic map position of _ col , CMF _ , _ ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ zcct _ gene in the OWB population be integrate into the barley consensus map base on co-segregation with genetic marker common to both map . dna polymorphism be genotype in the map population by direct sequencing of pcr amplicon use the polymorphism list in . this wheat marker , and barley snp 11_20840 -lrb- which cosegregate with _ hvcmf6a/hvcmf6b _ and the flowering time qtl in barley -rrb- , originate from orthologous gene . use cd from the eight previously report arabidopsis _ cmf _ gene a total of fifteen arabidopsis family member be identify . predict protein be translate use the VectorNTI Advance package v10 .1.1 -lrb- invitrogen -rrb- and protein domain determine use Pfam v25 .0 and Prosite v20 .79 . in addition , comparative analysis indicate that Poaceae _ cmf11 _ and triticeae _ zcct _ gene form a paralogous pair originate by ancestral wgd , confirm previous report in rice/brachypodium/barley . to determine if _ cmf _ gene arise independently by species-specific 5  truncation of _ COL _ or _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene , or whether they represent a more ancient gene family , we undertake molecular , phylogenetic and comparative genomic analysis of the _ cmf , COL _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene family in sequence Poaceae genome , as well the crop species barley , which lack a sequence physical map . the absence of arabidopsis gene within this sub-branch , and the clear grouping -lrb- and conserve intron structure -rrb- of arabidopsis _ col _ gene within the _ COL _ sub-branch , indicate the _ cmf/zcct _ branch evolve from common ancestor of the _ COL _ Group I gene after the monocot/dicot divergence . precocious flowering in tree : the _ FLOWERING LOCUS t _ gene as a research and breed tool in _ populus _ use cd for _ osh _ and _ ghd7 _ -lrb- _ osus _ -rrb- -lrb- both previously group within the _ COL _ gene family -rrb- and the arabidopsis _ cmf _ gene , a additional twelve member of the rice _ CMF _ gene family be identify , result in fourteen member distribute between ten chromosome . similarly , _ ZCCT _ copy number variation be associate with flowering time in tetraploid wheat . however , we note that _ hvco6 _ -lrb- orthologous to os06g44450 -rrb- have be map to this region in barley . although _ hvcmf7 _ be map to chromosome 7h , it be  5 cm distal to _ lks2 _ , indicate it be a unlikely candidate for the 7h flowering time qtl . in spring barley , the three _ zcct-h _ gene underlie the _ vrn-h2 _ locus have be delete in all accession investigate to date . future genetic mapping of _ hvco6 _ in the OWB population would help clarify its map position relative to _ nud , lks2 _ and the 7h flowering time qtl . further investigation be need to evaluate the candidacy of _ cmf6 _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene for the 1h , 1bl and 1dl meta-qtl . Poaceae _ cmf6 _ gene form a distinct sub-cluster within Clade 4 , with the cct domain encode by _ hvcmf6b _ the most diverged . result be summarise in . in the case of Poaceae _ osb _ and _ osg _ orthologue in the _ COL _ sub-branch , the two b-box find in all other COL Group I protein have be fuse into one chimeric domain . analysis resolve five major grouping , name Clade 1 -- 5 . three additional _ oscol _ gene be identify -lrb- term _ osq , osr _ and _ oss _ , respectively -rrb- , result in a total of seventeen _ COL _ gene , distribute across chromosome os2 -- os4 and os6 -- os9 . although partial sequencing of _ hvcmf6a _ do not identify any non-synonymous mutation , _ hvcmf6b _ be map as a presence/absence polymorphism , indicate that deletion , or mutation within primer binding-site , could result in a _ hvcmf6b _ allele of altered function in the owb-r parental line . the role of double-stranded break repair in the creation of phenotypic diversity at cereal _ vrn1 _ locus nevertheless , it be unclear whether the naturally occur flowering time qtl in barley and wheat correspond to _ ENSEMBLGENE _ homologue , with genetic mapping suggest _ eam8 _ be distal to the barley qtl . gene be prefix with the genus and species initial . all contain a single cct domain as the only identifiable domain within they predict protein , and be name here in chromosome order as _ oscmf1-oscmf14 _ . while homologue for _ oscmf2 , oscmf8 , oscmf12 _ and _ oscmf14 _ be absent , one additional brachypodium member be identify : _ bdcmf15 _ -lrb- for which no homologue be identify in any of the other Poaceae species investigate -rrb- . while the majority of _ cmf _ gene predate monocot/dicot divergence , a minority appear to have evolve more recently -lrb- _ atcmf2 , atcmf5 , atcmf7 , oscmf2 , sbcmf16 _ -rrb- . indeed , clade 1 member illustrate the mechanism by which _ cmf _ gene may have evolve from _ col _ gene after the divergence of the Bryophyta and flowering plant , by creation of non-functional chimeric b-box and they subsequent degradation/mutation , as evidence by the protein encode by the paralogous _ zcct-cmf11 _ gene pair . no homologue _ osb _ and _ osq _ be identify , although one _ bdcol _ gene lack a rice homologue rice be identify -lrb- _ bdco2 _ . within clade 2 , the _ CMF _ and _ COL _ Group II sub-branch be phylogeneticly link , indicate Clade 2 _ cmf _ gene evolve from Group II _ COL _ gene , between 400  200 mya . brachypodium be find to contain eleven _ CMF _ member . although three _ sicmf _ gene be not annotated as _ S. italica _ gene model , gene-prediction reanalysis of genomic region identify by blastn analysis resolve _ cmf _ gene in all three instance . _ oscmf _ physical map location show they be located in distinct genomic region relative to _ oscol _ gene -lrb- , s4 -rrb- , indicate the two gene family do not arise due to tandem duplication and subsequent loss of b-box domain in the rice lineage . all remain _ oscmf _ gene have orthologue located at colinear chromosomal position in  2 grass species . foxtail millet be find to possess eleven _ cmf _ gene , lack homologue of rice gene _ oscmf2 , oscmf13 _ and _ oscmf14 _ . such gene cluster unambiguously within _ COL _ phylogenetic clade , with comparative mapping in the Poaceae indicate they mutate from _ col _ gene after separation of the lineage investigate . although _ col _ gene be absent at the corresponding region of chromosomal duplication , _ cmf2 _ gene be present in all species investigate , indicate that Poaceae _ OsS _ and _ cmf2 _ orthologue be relate by evolutionary descent . the second _ col _ gene located with a region of wgd be _ oss _ and its Poaceae orthologue -lrb- _ col19 _ -rrb- . to help understand the evolution of the _ cmf _ gene family , protein sequence from the cct domain encode by Poaceae and arabidopsis _ CMF , COL , ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ zcct _ gene be use to construct a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree . analysis of the brachypodium genome return sixteen _ COL _ gene . of the remain five _ oscol _ gene , two be located within duplicated genomic region . _ osa _ -lrb- chromosome os06 -rrb- reside within a chromosomal region display intra-specific colinearity with a region of chromosome os02 . protein identify as contain a cct motif -lrb- and lack additional domain -rrb- be annotated as _ cmf _ gene . amino acid sequence representation be undertake use WebLogo . sorghum and foxtail millet be fond to possess sixteen and seventeen _ COL _ gene , respectively . accordingly , we name this group of gene the ` _ CCT MOTIF family _ ' -lrb- _ cmf _ -rrb- , follow the protein annotation in the rice genome assembly . japonica cv . thus , differential retention/deletion/mutation of gene contain cct domain appear to have be critical in the domestication and adaptation of cereal crop . recently , eight member homologous to arabidopsis _ activator of Spomin : : luc2 _ -lrb- _ asml2 _ -rrb- have be identify , which also encode protein possess just a single cct domain . recently , map-based cloning of the rice flowering time locus _ ghd7 _ -lrb- previously term , _ osus _ -rrb- have find it to be encode by a circadianly regulate group iv _ COL _ gene . the remain Poaceae _ COL _ gene orthologous to _ OsG _ and _ osj _ be not located within duplicated chromosomal region . enhance expression of _ ghd7 _ under non-inductive ld photoperiod delay flowering . no _ oscmf2 _ homologue be identify in any other species investigate , suggest it represent a recently truncate _ COL _ gene . two _ oscmf6 _ homologue be identify in barley : a 11 bp intronic indel allow mapping of _ hvcmf6a _ to the distal end of chromosome 1h at 156.3 cm , where it cosegregate with nine previously map marker . of the five highly conserve cct domain residue identify -lrb- tyr23-arg26-ala30-arg35-gly38 -rrb- , all but Try23 be located in the nf-ya2 sub-domain of ENSEMBLGENE , though to mediate the interaction of ENSEMBLGENE with ccaat dna sequence . indeed , arabidopsis _ CO _ and _ col15 _ have be show to interact with several ENSEMBLGENE protein _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ . _ osa _ orthologue be present in all Poaceae species , and while no _ osa _ paralogue be present on rice chromosome os02 , brachypodium , sorghum , foxtail millet and barley all retain a paralogue at colinear position within they genome . furthermore , naturally occur _ ghd7 _ deletions/mutations alleviate floral repression under ld . although no sorghum gene model homologous to _ osprr95 _ be identify , a unannotated genomic region with high sequence homology -lrb- 4.3e-60 -rrb- be identify . Nipponbare , ENSEMBLGENE osa1 assembly v6 .1 , -rrb- use blastn search -lrb- match / mismatch score = 2,3 ; gap cost : existence = 5 , extension = 2 -rrb- and a expectation -lrb- e -rrb- - value threshold of 1.0e-30 . however , it should more correctly be annotated accord to the photoperiod insensitive _ sbprr37-2 ma1 _ allele , previously report to possess 8 exon . by compare inter - and intra-species microcolinearity between rice , brachypodium and barley , we previously show that the _ ZCCT _ gene and _ osh _ be evolutionarily related , form a paralogous gene-pair that arise during the whole genome duplication event that occur in the ancestral cereal genome . clade 2 consist of two separate sub-clade . they predict protein encode a cct domain and a putative single amino zinc finger , divergent from the b-box domain find in other _ col _ gene . use a snp in the 3  utr _ hvcmf3 _ be find to cosegregate with 17 genetic marker at 60.9 cm on 6h , while _ hvcmf4 _ cosegregate with four genetic marker at 101.9 cm on the long arm of 4h . primer for snp identification in parental line and genetic mapping in the complete population be design use primer3 v0 .4.0 . subsequently , orthologous _ zcct _ gene be find to co-segregate with the _ vrn-h2 _ locus in barley and the _ vrn-a1 / vrn-b1 _ locus in the tetraploid wheat , _ T. turgidum _ . genetic mapping be undertake in the barley owb double haploid population . of the fourteen member of the rice _ CMF _ gene family , _ oscmf2 _ have no orthologous Poaceae _ CMF g_enes , as while in rice it appear to have lose the n-terminus b-box domain , this motif be retain in colinear _ COL _ gene in all other grass investigate here . finally , we propose a systematic nomenclature for Poaceae _ CMF _ gene , base on orthology between species . the first be make up of the Poaceae and arabidopsis Group II _ COL _ gene , while the second consist of a cluster of Poaceae _ cmf3 _ and _ cmf9 _ member , four arabidopsis _ cmf _ gene -lrb- _ atcmf3 ,9,11,14 _ -rrb- , and the Poaceae _ cmf7 _ gene -lrb- _ sbcmf7 , sicmf7 _ and _ hvcmf7 _ be exclude from phylogenetic analysis due to deletion within the genomic region encode the cct domain -rrb- . similarly , sorghum and foxtail millet contain homologue of _ bdco2 _ , although in sorghum , the predict protein do not contain a b-box domain , and be therefore classify as a _ cmf _ gene -lrb- _ sbcmf16 _ -rrb- . the remainder of the branch consist exclusively of the barley _ zcct-ha , -

and _ taprr _ at the hexaploid wheat _ ppd-b1 _ photoperiod locus . in addition , eight of the fifteen arabidopsis _ cmf _ homologue cluster within Clade 4 . all Poaceae _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene cluster together within Clade 5 , along with a single arabidopsis _ cmf _ gene -lrb- _ atcmf7 _ -rrb- , indicate it may represent a recently truncate _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene . all Poaceae _ CMF , COL _ and _ zcct _ gene be partition within the four remain phylogenetic grouping . clade 4 compromise exclusively of Poaceae and arabidopsis _ CMF _ gene , with sub-clustering evident for gene pair _ cmf1-cmf5 , dmf4 _ - _ cmf10 _ and _ cmf12-cmf13 _ . additional qtl have be map towards the telomeric region of chromosome 1hl -- , and between the _ Nud _ and _ lks2 _ locus on chromosome 7h . flowering time qtl have be previously map in this region in other barley population -- , as have the early flowering mutant _ early maturity 8 _ -lrb- _ eam8 _ -rrb- . _ ghd7 _ be the most recently identify _ col _ gene to have a proven role in the control of flowering time in the Poaceae . with one exception -lrb- due to the absence of _ osq _ orthologue -rrb- , these paralogous pair be conserve in all Poaceae species investigate . sub-clustering of Poaceae _ COL _ gene pair homologous to _ osm-osn , oso-osq , osp-osr _ and _ oss-ost _ be evident , while arabidopsis gene _ atcmf2 _ and _ atcmf5 _ form a distinct group off the _ S-T _ branch , as do a single _ cmf _ gene -lrb- _ oscmf2 _ -rrb- . we find _ hvcmf6a _ and _ hvcmf6b _ -lrb- orthologous to os05g51630 -rrb- to cosegregate with abg387a and 11_20840 on the long arm of chromosome 1h . all but three of the forty-two Clade 3 gene belong to the _ col _ gene family , and possess a single zinc finger domain towards they n-terminus . the presence of tandemly array b-box domain contain the short stretch of sequence conservation necessary for non-homologous end join -lrb- nhej -rrb- follow double-stranded dna break , provide a possible mechanism for b-box contraction . the second sub-grouping contain fourteen _ cmf _ gene split between two main branch . the first branch contain _ cmf11 _ homologue from each of the five Poaceae species investigate , as well as _ cmf8 _ gene from rice , sorghum and foxtail millet . if the cct domain of cmf protein retain similar function , the absence of b-box domain -lrb- which mediate protein-protein interaction -rrb- could further alter the binding , composition and function of such protein complex , and they result transcriptional modulation . of the seventeen rice _ COL _ gene and they Poaceae orthologue , the majority form paralogous gene pair arise from the ancestral wgd -lrb- _ osc-osd _ , _ ose _ - _ osf _ , _ osk-osl _ , _ osm-osn _ , _ oso-osq _ , _ osp-osr _ -rrb- . while the remain three _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene originate from region involve in the WGD , paralogous gene have be lose in all Poaceae species investigate . of the additional eight _ hvcol _ and four _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene identify here , all be find to contain genetic polymorphism between parental Oregon Wolfe Barley-Dominant -lrb- owb-d -rrb- and owb-recessive -lrb- owb-r -rrb- line , allow subsequent genetic mapping . combined analysis of inter - and intra-specific colinearity allow identification of paralogous gene pair that arise due to ancestral wgd . furthermore , no _ cmf _ gene -lrb- which could have evolve from _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene by truncation of the pseudo-receiver domain at the n-terminus -rrb- be located in within these genomic location . as nine _ COL _ gene and _ hvprr37 _ -lrb- _ ppd-h1 _ -rrb- have previously be genetically map , , they map location in the barley consensus map be estimate utilize comparative approach . to investigate the gene evolution in the context of intra-specific genome duplication that arise due to wgd in the ancestral grass genome -- , , -- , the position of rice _ cmf , COL _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene relative to wgd block be analyse . with the exception of gene present in just one species -lrb- _ oscmf14 , bdcmf15 , osq _ -rrb- , colinear cross-species genomic location of all remain _ cmf , COL _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene be establish . as chimeric or degraded b-box domain be absent in arabidopsis col protein , , , it appear that the evolutionary process of b-box elimination be prominent in Poaceae Clade 1 . integration of the ten previously map _ CMF , COL , ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ zcct _ gene allow subsequent comparative analysis all barley gene family to be conduct across five Poaceae species . the first map across the _ vrn-h2 _ locus , encode by the _ zcct-ha , - hb , - hc _ gene . we previously map _ hvcmf11 _ -lrb- previously know as _ hvco9 _ -rrb- to the long arm of 1h , be it be find to cosegregate with five gene-based marker , allow integration into the consensus map . initially , integration of barley _ CMF , COL , ENSEMBLGENE _ and _ ZCCT _ genetic map location into the consensus map -lrb- , s3 -rrb- allow investigation of they chromosomal location within the framework of barley-rice colinearity . a presence/absence polymorphism map _ hvcmf5 _ to 94.2 cm on the long arm of 1h , cosegregate with 12_30072 and bpb-8477 . pattern of macro-colinearity be confirm by investigation of microcolinearity around _ cmf , COL _ and _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene in the four sequence grass genome . such flanking motif have previously be observe in plant surround nhej deletion within transposable element and similar deletion within plant gene be responsible for the creation of novel phenotypic variation . use snp c340/g -lrb- gln  glu -rrb- , _ hvcmf1 _ be map to the long arm of chromosome 1h at 127.9 cm , between snp marker 11_21081 and 11_21277 . the presence of corresponding region of segmental duplication in each of the sequence grass species be verify at the micro-synteny level by blastn analysis of gene content surround all cct domain gene . of the five _ ENSEMBLGENE _ gene find in each Poaceae species , _ prr37 _ and _ prr73 _ appear to have originate from a common ancestor prior to WGD . all twenty of the map barley gene be located within broader region of established inter-specific colinearity . comparative mapping allow the genome of rice , sorghum , brachypodium , foxtail millet and barley to be align , and block of conserve synteny to be establish . _ cmf _ homologue for twelve of the fourteen rice member be identify in sorghum , with cd range from 678 -- 1374 bp .

KATO III cell be grow by the National Cell Culture Center -lrb- Minneapolis , mn -rrb- and ship overnight on wet ice prior to extract preparation . additional mutational analysis be facilitate by the development of a fluorescent splicing reporter assay that allow we to directly determine the function of ise/iss -3 use green fluorescence . alternative splicing represent a important mechanism use by the cell to generate multiple transcript from a single gene and at least 60 % of gene appear to generate more than one splice mrna . we recently identify ise/iss -3 -lrb- intronic splicing Enhancer/Intronic Splicing silencer-3 -rrb- , so name because its deletion lead to loss of cell-type-specific enhancement of exon iiib as well as loss of exon iiic repression in cell that express fgfr2-iiib . however , it remain unclear whether the ise and iss activity we describe be carry out by distinct sequence within the element , or whether the same sequence be involve in both activity . expression of fgfr2-iiib be generally restricted to epithelial cell and fgfr2-iiic to mesenchymal cell and disruption of the cell-type-specific splicing pattern of ENSEMBLGENE have be implicate as one event that can play a role in cancer progression , include DETECTEDPHENO cancer . in contrast , while intronic element -lrb- ise and isss -rrb- have be show to influence the splicing of some constitutive exon , they have predominantly be describe in regulation of alternatively splice exon . therefore , in order to further assess the effect of the different branch nucleotide in a more relevant context we determine they effect on splicing use pre-mrna contain the 3  splice site of exon iiic . such observation have lead to model of combinatorial control whereby the splicing outcome be determine by the net activity of several splicing regulatory factor that bind these element . however , result present here that include use of newly develop _ in vitro _ splicing assay of fgfr2 use extract from a cell line express fgfr2-iiib strongly suggest that cell-type-specific silencing of exon iiic occur at or prior to the first step of splicing . although we be unable to generate splicing competent nuclear extract from dt3 cell , we have obtain nuclear extract from the human KATO III cell line that be competent for _ in vitro _ splicing . of note , a recent publication use a fluorescent reporter system and sequence library to identify sequence that function as esss in living cell and be use to identify conserve motif that mediate exon skip . use this fluorescent reporter , we screen a set of more discrete mutation in ise/iss -3 and use flow cytometry we identify a single GU to ac mutation that significantly impair its function . subsequently , u2 be recruit to the branchpoint , follow by addition of u4 , u5 and u6 . to generate the fluorescent minigene pkc-neg-33 .51 - if-5-egfp we first modify piresneo3 -lrb- clontech -rrb- by remove the synthetic intron . we previously show that the entire ise/iss -3 element can independently activate exon iiib as well as repress exon iiic in dt3 cell . pkc-neg-33 .51 - if-5-egfp be then generate by insert the 33.51 exon and flanking intron sequence in the bamh1 and xhous site in the intron of pkc-neg-egfp -lrb- further detail available on request -rrb- . however , it remain possible that some sequence within ise/iss -3 could activate splicing of the upstream exon iiib , while other sequence be predominantly involve in repression of the downstream exon iiic . among the mutation confirm by rt -- pcr to cause significant impairment in ise/iss -3 function be a single substitution of a ac for a GU -lrb- , c -- f , construct 10 , Mut GU -rrb- . plasmid minigene construct be generate contain the wild-type ise/iss -3 element or ise/iss -3 element contain each of 14 different mutation . again , we note a very tight correlation between exon inclusion relative to the wild-type element as determine by mean fluorescence and rt -- pcr . thus , if a optimal bp be combine with the already optimal PPT the combined ` strength ' of these signal may preclude exon silencing . several splicing regulatory factor , include fox-1 , Nova , ENSEMBLGENE family member and sr protein , have be show to have dual role as both activator and repressor of splicing . the initial step include binding of u1 at the 5  splice site , u2-auxiliary factor 65 and 35 kda subunit -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE and ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- to the PPT and 3  splice site , and splicing factor 1/branchpoint bridge protein -lrb- sf1/mbbp -rrb- to the branchpoint . the fact that exon iiic skip decrease with progressive truncation of intron 8 from the 5  end could signify a sequence-dependent contribution from upstream element on exon iiic repression . all plasmid construct be prepare with Qiagen MidiPrep kit . interestingly , the combination of a optimal bp and a suboptimal PPT elicit result that be very similar to those with the opposite combination ; ise/iss -3 cause a > 2-fold decrease in exon iiic inclusion in dt3 cell -lrb- , lane 10 and 11 -rrb- . in helum extract , the first step be nearly as efficient with g or c as the branch nucleotide , and appear somewhat less efficient with U -lrb- and d -rrb- . we note that this mutation occur within a 8 nt sequence consist entirely of g or Us that be completely conserve among the species examine in , and both mutation involve this region -lrb- mut 1 and mut 2 -rrb- impaired splicing regulation . sequence of all the minigene describe be confirm by sequence analysis by the University of Pennsylvania sequencing facility . thus , it contain ise/iss -3 as well as the entire region encompass the 3  splice site of exon iiic . thus , it be clear that there be substrate and/or sequence-context-dependent difference in the degree to which different bpss affect splicing . previous study by we laboratory and other have identify several auxiliary _ ci _ - element that can positively or negatively influence inclusion of either exon iiib or iiic and be summarize in . the 3  splice site consist of a invariant AG at the end of the intron and a polypyrimidine tract -lrb- ppt -rrb- located upstream from it . together , these result effectively preclude the possibility that ise/iss -3 function via a rna secondary structure with other sequence present in the ENSEMBLGENE transcript , as be show for ise-2 and isar . the spliceosome consist of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle , u1 , u2 , u4 , u5 and u6 , which , together with numerous additional constitutive splicing factor , assemble in a stepwise fashion at the splice site . the enhance green fluorescent protein -lrb- egfp -rrb- sequence be modify by replace the atg at the 5  end of the coding sequence with atc , and a linker sequence 5  - gcttaattaat-3  be insert between this substitute codon and the 3  splice site of the upstream intron . this minigene contain both exon iiib and iiic as well as all other known regulatory _ ci _ - element show in . all ise/iss -3 mutation and the ppt mutation be introduce use pcr-based oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis . however , in the minigene that contain both exon iiib and iiic it be not possible to separately examine the effect of each mutation on these two distinct regulatory property . furthermore , a system such as that describe here should facilitate systematic identification of sequence motif that can function as ise through screening of randomize sequence library . the difference between these insert be a non-functional 20 nt at the 3  end of the 105 nt element . the fact that three different sequence replacement achieve similar outcome suggest that the reduction in exon 33.51 inclusion result from loss of sequence in ise/iss -3 that be critical for its function and be not due to the unintended introduction of sequence that silence its splicing . pi-11 -lrb- - h3 -rrb- - 1 , pi-11 -lrb- - h3 -rrb- - 2 , pi-11 -lrb- - h3 -rrb- - 3 and pi-11 -lrb- - h3 -rrb- - 4 minigene be make by first use pcr of pi-11-fs-cx with forward primer intron-2f -lrb- 5  - ccggactagtcaacgtttttgtgtttgtgt-3  -rrb- , ias2-f-spe -lrb- 5  - actagttggccatggaaaaatgccca-3  -rrb- , 3cplus-f-spe -lrb- 5  - actagttgtgggctgatttttccatg-3  -rrb- and 3cminus-f-spe -lrb- 5  - actagtatcgatgtgtggtgatgggc-3  -rrb- , respectively , and the reverse primer int-3cr-sal -lrb- 5  - gtcgacggtcggaaatcattcgaaac-3  -rrb- follow by clone into the xbaus and xhous site of pi-11 -lrb- - h3 -rrb- - pl . to further investigate whether exon iiic silencing can only occur with a weak branchpoint , we introduce mutation in the ppt of exon iiic and test the effect of these mutation on exon iiic splicing . we previously map the branchpoint nucleotide use during exon iiic splicing by primer extension and determine that the primary branch nucleotide be a guanine -lrb- g -rrb- . upstream of the PPT be the branchpoint sequence -lrb- bp -rrb- that be also involve in recognition of the 3  splice site . although neither the presence of a suboptimal bp nor ppt alone be capable of induce exon iiic skip in at3 cell , the combination of both result in predominant exon iiic skip -lrb- , lane 4 -- 6 -rrb- . this be consistent with we previous _ in vitro _ branchpoint mapping in helum cell and suggest that use of a alternative adenine branchsite upstream of this region be unlikely to account for exon iiic inclusion in cell that express endogenous fgfr2-iiic . thus , for example , a Nova binding site that function as a intronic splicing enhancer downstream of a exon silence splicing when reposition within the exon . these mutation be introduce in the context of both the wild-type g branchpoint and in minigene contain the optimal adenine branch nucleotide . to simplify the analysis , we introduce these mutation in the context of the pi-11-fs-cxs-iiib-mut minigene to limit the analysis to exon iiic inclusion . we substitute 3 guanine residue for 3 u residue in the PPT as show in . how the same protein complex assemble on ise/iss -3 enhance exon iiib inclusion will also require further study . . we observation that the first step of splicing to exon iiic be least efficient with U as the branch nucleotide contrast with the previously cite work in which g show the lowest relative splicing efficiency for both step . the important role that intronic sequence play in alternative splicing be further highlight by the fact that intron sequence flank alternatively splice exon -lrb- exclusive of the splice site -rrb- be more highly conserve phylogenetically than those flanking constitutively splice exon . we previously identify a rna _ ci _ - element , ise/iss -3 , that enhance exon iiib splicing and silence exon iiic splicing . furthermore , the relative effect of the GU to ac mutant be nearly identical to that observe with the wild-type bp and ppt -lrb- , lane 12 -rrb- . the wild-type bp use , cua_g_c , be a perfect match to the minimal mammalian branchpoint consensus , cur_a_c , with the exception of g in place of the highly prefer a as the primary branch nucleotide -lrb- as indicate by the underline nucleotide -rrb- . exon iiic silencing be dependent upon a suboptimal branchpoint sequence contain a guanine branchpoint nucleotide . the result minigene , therefore , encompass a spectrum in which both the BPS and the PPT be ` strong , ' either the bp or the PPT be ` weak , ' or in which both be ` weak ' . in contrast , whereas g result in the greatest inhibition of the second step , exon iiic repression in dt3 cell be greater with U than it be with g . the function of many auxiliary _ ci _ - element be mediate by splicing regulatory protein that bind these element and facilitate or prevent splicing at nearby splice site . all minigene be make use standard cloning technique . thus , we have every reason to believe that this position within the overall bp element represent the branchpoint nucleotide with each of these substitution . we determine that specific sequence within this element that mediate splicing enhancement also mediate splicing repression , depend on they position relative to a regulate exon . nonetheless , in each case the wild-type ise/iss -3 sequence be capable of repress exon iiic splicing in a sequence-dependent manner . thus , factor that bind the element be likely to be coordinately involve in mediate both aspect of splicing regulation . previous study of exon iiic splicing in helum nuclear extract demonstrate that this guanine branchsite primarily impair the second step of splicing suggest that ise/iss -3 may block exon iiic inclusion at this step . the fact that substitution of a consensus bp abolish exon iiic skip in dt3 cell be consistent with this possibility . alternative splicing of fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 -lrb- fgfr2 -rrb- mutually exclusive exon iiib and iiic result in highly cell-type-specific expression of functionally distinct receptor , fgfr2-iiib and fgfr2-iiic . similar to we use here , flow cytometry can be use in conjunction with mutational analysis to characterize other ise . we have be study the mechanism that lead to cell-type-specific splicing of two mutually exclusive exon , iiib and iiic , in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- transcript . the highly uncommon use of g as the branch nucleotide suggest that the mechanism of exon iiic repression may specifically require a weak branchpoint . we then further test each bps/ppt combination when ise/iss -3 be present , delete or mutate with the single GU to ac mutation describe in -lrb- GU Mut -rrb- . we mutate all GU or UG dinucleotide in either the 5  or 3  half of ise/iss -3 to ac , ga or ENSEMBLGENE . we also note that mutation that impair splicing regulation be somewhat more prevalent within a highly conserve stretch at the 5  end of the element contain several GU or UG dinucleotide . in the case of both the wild-type g branchpoint as well as when it be substitute with a , we previously confirm experimentally use _ in vitro _ splicing assay that the indicate branchpoint nucleotide be indeed the predominant branch nucleophile -lrb- -rrb- -lrb- datum not show -rrb- . we nonetheless note that ise/iss -3 could still induce a further decrease in exon iiic inclusion . however , in contrast to the result see in dt3 cell , we note no measurable difference between the level of skip in the absence or presence of wild-type ise/iss -3 . these exon encode two different peptide sequence in the extracellular portion of the receptor yield two different isoform , fgfr2-iiib and fgfr2-iiic , with distinctly different ligand binding preference . for this analysis , we quantify exon iiic inclusion to include the product contain both exon iiib and iiic -lrb- ` double inclusion ' -rrb- as well as those only include exon iiic . however , when ise/iss -3 contain mutation 13 , exon iiic skip be decrease -lrb- , lane 2 -rrb- . thus , strong phylogenetic conservation of intronic sequence flank alternative exon be presume to reflect sequence-specific binding of regulatory factor that be involve in conserve alternative splicing event . we transcribe pre-mrnas _ in vitro _ that contain the wild-type g branch nucleotide as well as a , c and u as be do in the transfect minigene . therefore , these result _ in vivo _ be not seemingly consistent with the hypothesis that exon iiic repression in dt3 cell occur during the second step of splicing . thus , ise/iss -3 can function in a cell-type-specific manner to promote exon iiic skip when the 3  splice site contain either a suboptimal bp or a suboptimal ppt . as a additional control we also insert a size-matched sequence derive from a -globin intron . in this minigene , pkc-neg-33 .51 - if-5-egfp , a 5  terminal exon be substitute that consist of a 159 nt open reading frame derive from rat protein kinase c -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- -  contain a optimal kozak consensus sequence at the 5  end . furthermore , these result suggest that the 5  end of ise/iss -3 be require in order to enhance splicing of a upstream exon whereas sequence in the 3  half of the element contribute , but be less crucial . in at least a few case , the ability of these protein to function either as enhancer or as repressor of splicing be dependent on the position of the corresponding binding site relative to a alternatively splice exon . of further note , the fact that mutation of the PPT result in significant impairment of exon iiic inclusion in at3 cell that could be rescue by change the branchpoint g to a a suggest that this be also the branchpoint use _ in vivo _ in cell that express ENSEMBLGENE . derivative plasmid show in be generate by insert ise/iss -3 or mutant control between the claus and xhous site . while these protein may directly promote spliceosome assembly on exon iiib , a alternative model be that they may interfere with factor bind at upstream iss element that have previously be show to otherwise silence exon iiib exon definition . we generate minigene in which we replace the G branch nucleotide with a , c or u and assess they ability to repress exon iiic in transfect dt3 cell . however , the result present here argue strongly against this possibility for frfr2 exon iiic . however , in KATO III extract , the first step of splicing be significantly less efficient with either g or c relative to a and U result in the greatest impairment -lrb- and e -rrb- . frequently , multiple auxiliary _ ci _ - element be present within or flanking alternatively splice exon and positively or negatively influence splice site recognition . for these two minigene , the actual rt -- pcr datum be show at far right and datum for all mutation be present graphically in the middle . we find that the effect of each branchsite nucleotide on exon iiic inclusion in transfect dt3 cell correlate with the efficiency of the first , but not second , step of splicing in KATO III extract . a 3  terminal exon be insert that contain a coding sequence for egfp . in contrast , the other seven mutation result in lesser degree of impairment in ise/iss -3 function . . complete replacement of ise/iss -3 with the b control sequence result in a greater decrease in exon skip to 38 % -lrb- , lane 3 -rrb- . thus , weak splice site at either end of a exon can provide a opportunity for additional auxiliary _ ci _ - element to assemble complex that prevent splicing of the exon . we previously demonstrate that the ability of ise/iss -3 to silence exon iiic be facilitate by a highly atypical use of guanine as the primary branch nucleotide . we therefore test all of the mutation in context in which these activation and repression function can be independently analyze . we use the same fluorescence-based minigene construct to screen a number of more discrete mutation in ise/iss -3 and use flow cytometric analysis to identify several mutation that result in the greatest loss of exon 33.51 inclusion . _ in vitro _ splicing reaction be carry out in both helum and KATO III nuclear extract and the efficiency of both step of splicing be determine . the ise/iss -3 element present in all other figure consist of the 85 nt sequence element show in be make by pcr amplification of pi-11-f with primer ise-3-cla-f2 and ise3-xho-r5 -lrb- 5  - ctcgagccaactgcagcccgtccaca-3  -rrb- . the intron sequence and the exon 33.51 sequence be unchanged from that of pi-xn-33 .51 - if5 . thus , ise/iss -3 function in a cell-type-specific manner to promote splicing of exon iiib in favor of exon iiic . whereas the branchsite nucleotide and the 3  splice site yag clearly play a role in the efficiency of the second step of splicing , the PPT do not appear to influence splicing efficiency after the first step of splicing . therefore , it be assume that the element be bind by regulatory _ trans _ - act factor that play a role in splicing regulation . in addition , insertion of the size-matched control BG sequence do not restore exon iiib splicing , further support a conclusion that specific sequence of ise-iss-3 be require for ENSEMBLGENE splicing regulation . overall , these result suggest that several sequence motif along the length of the element be collectively require to mediate the role of ise/iss -3 in maintain fgfr2-iiib expression . however , inclusion of the 46 nt exon 33.51 be predict to restore a reading frame encode a egfp fusion protein contain the ENSEMBLGENE and exon 33.51 encode amino acid at the 5  end . exon definition involve cross-exon interaction whereby factor that bind the 5  and 3  splice site , often assist by factor bind at ESE element , cooperatively facilitate inclusion of the exon . when the result of the mutation of ise/iss -3 on exon iiib splicing in dt3 cell be analyze , we note that seven mutation -lrb- mut 1 , mut 2 , mut 4 , mut 6 , Mut 9 , mut 11 and Mut 13 -rrb- result in a > 25 % reduction in exon iiib inclusion compare with the wild-type element . as show in and d , it can be see that the same mutation that cause a switch from exon iiib to iiic splicing generally also affect both splicing enhancement of a upstream exon as well as silencing of a downstream exon , although there be some difference in the relative degree to which the different mutation affect each function . in the case of ENSEMBLGENE or ENSEMBLGENE , it have be propose that bind site on both side of a regulate exon can repress its inclusion either through protein -- protein interaction by protein bind on both side of the exon that ` loop out ' the exon or create a ` zone of silencing ' that sequester the exon and prevent its splicing . with minigene construct 4 , none of the intron 8 sequence upstream of ise/iss -3 , include the ugcaug motif , be present , signify that it can function to silence exon iiic in they absence . consistent with we previous result , when both the BPS and PPT be ` optimal ' we note nearly constitutive level of exon iiic splicing in the presence or absence of wild-type ise/iss -3 ; over 92 % exon iiic inclusion be achieve in dt3 or at3 cell , although there be still a slightly decrease level with ise/iss -3 in dt3 cell -lrb- and c , lane 7 -- 10 -rrb- . therefore , the fact that either a ` weak ' bp or a ` weak ' ppt can facilitate cell-type-specific exon iiic silencing be further evidence that this regulation do not involve the second step . in the first catalytic step , a branchpoint nucleotide -lrb- usually adenine -rrb- carry out a nucleophilic attack at the 5  end of the intron to yield a branch structure contain a 2  -- 5  phosphodiester bond between the branchpoint nucleotide and the guanine residue at the 5  end of the intron . these minigene be transfect into dt3 and at3 cell and pool of cell stably transfect with the minigene be use to harvest rna and the level of exon iiib or iiic splicing be determine use a previously validate rt -- pcr assay -lrb- see , far right -rrb- . as expect , in extract from either cell type , both step of splicing be most efficient when a adenine residue be the branch nucleotide . we have previously show that ise/iss -3 play a role in both activation of exon iiib splicing and silencing of exon iiic splicing in cell type that express fgfr2-iiib from its position in the intron -lrb- intron 8 -rrb- located between these mutually exclusive exon . we thus reason that if substitution of a c as the branch nucleotide also lead to constitutive use of exon iiic this would be consistent with repression occur at the second step . we have show that transfection of we fgfr2 minigene in helum cell result in exclusive exon iiic splicing as observe in at3 cell -lrb- datum not show -rrb- , indicate that helum extract would be unlikely to contain factor involve in exon iiic silencing . because g be show to inhibit the second step of splicing to a greater degree than the first step _ in vitro _ use helum cell nuclear extract , we hypothesize that repression of exon iiic splicing might occur during the second step of splicing . in contrast , deletion of ise/iss -3 do not result in any change in at3 cell -lrb- that express fgfr2-iiic -rrb- , which maintain exclusive inclusion of exon iiic . these finding also lend some insight into the mechanism through which ise/iss -3 mediate exon iiic repression . the pre-mrna we use contain the same sequence use in construct 3 as show in , but only contain sequence comprise the 5  half of exon iiic . the fact that several of the mutation of ise/iss -3 result in a partial switch from exon iiib to exon iiic splicing suggest that they disrupt sequence require for exon iiib activation , exon iiic repression or both . we perform extensive mutational analysis of the ise/iss -3 element in order to better understand its role in ENSEMBLGENE splicing regulation . because cytosine -lrb- c -rrb- or uracil -lrb- u -rrb- branchpoint differentially inhibit the first and second step of splicing relative to the prefer a , we seek to provide further evidence for or against this hypothesis by directly compare the efficiency of exon iiic repression use all four possible branch nucleotide . we show that substitution of a adenine -lrb- a -rrb- in place of the branchsite guanine upstream of exon iiic abrogate the ability of ise/iss -3 to repress exon iiic splicing in dt3 cell with a switch toward constitutive inclusion of exon iiic . in addition to the splice site consensus sequence , the pattern of splicing be further influence by auxiliary _ ci _ - element refer to as exonic or intronic splicing enhancer -lrb- ese or ise -rrb- and exonic or intronic splicing silencer -lrb- esss or isss -rrb- . when the wild-type -lrb- suboptimal -rrb- bp and wild-type -lrb- optimal -rrb- ppt be use , ise/iss -3 result in a > 2-fold decrease in exon inclusion in dt3 cell , consistent with previous datum -lrb- , lane 1 and 2 -rrb- . Products that skip exon iiic include those that only include exon iiib or those that skip both exon . relative to use of a as the branch nucleotide , c have previously be show to be less efficient during the first step of splicing , but the second step of splicing show no impairment in helum nuclear extract . because guanine as a branch nucleotide be show to impair the second step of splicing more than the first step of splicing in helum nuclear extract , we previously hypothesize that exon iiic silencing may be regulate at the second catalytic step . thus , deletion of ise/iss -3 independently result in both loss of exon iiib splicing activation and loss of exon iiic repression in dt3 cell -lrb- that express fgfr2-iiib -rrb- . the relative rate of the second step of splicing be similar in both cell type with a order of efficiency use each nucleotide be a  c > U > G. thus , the efficiency of the first step of exon iiic splicing in KATO III extract use each possible branchsite nucleotide correlate directly with the degree to which exon iiic splicing occur _ in vivo _ in dt3 cell . when a be substitute , exon iiic be include in over 94 % of splice product -lrb- and c , lane 2 -rrb- . however , use a newly develop _ in vitro _ splicing system from a cell type that express fgfr2-iiib , we show here that the ability of different branch nucleotide to carry out exon iiic splicing _ in vivo _ correlate with they efficiency in carry out the first step of splicing _ in vitro _ . ise/iss -3 , mut 13 and BG be subsequently insert into the clai/xhoi site of the respective minigene as show in . similarly , fox-1 binding site upstream of a atp synthase g subunit exon mediate exon skip whereas they mediate exon inclusion when position downstream of a fibronectin exon . when the BPS and PPT be both suboptimal we note a dramatic reduction in exon iiic inclusion in dt3 cell -lrb- , lane 4 -- 6 -rrb- . previous result from analysis of the intron 8 element that activate splicing of exon iiib suggest that the most robust splicing activation involve the concerted action of several element in addition to ise/iss -3 , include ise-1 , ise-2 , isar and a ugcaug sequence motif located between isar and ise/iss -3 . however , this could also represent a non-specific effect due to approximation of the upstream exon to the 3  splice site of exon iiic . in at3 cell , there be no difference in splicing of minigene contain ise/iss -3 or in which it be delete ; they include almost exclusively product contain exon iiic -lrb- datum not show -rrb- . in the second catalytic step , the upstream exon be ligate to the 3  exon with release of the intron as a branch intron . thus , the splice site -lrb- include the bp -rrb- be often describe as be ` strong ' or ` weak ' depend on they conformity to the consensus , which be presume to reflect they inherent ability to recruit the spliceosome . datum quantification be perform use a molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager . use fluorescent reporter minigene we initially determine that highly conserve gu-rich sequence in ise/iss -3 , in particular those in the 5  end of the element , be essential for its sequence-specific splicing regulatory activity . sequence contain the mutation be initially insert into a ENSEMBLGENE minigene , pi-11-fs-cx , in which ise/iss -3 have be delete and replace with claus and xhous restriction site . these result thus demonstrate that ise/iss -3 be a distinct element with dual effect on splicing and thus do not consist of separable element that independently either activate splicing of a upstream exon or repress splicing of a downstream exon . for both constitutive and alternatively splice exon and intron , the degree to which the splice site match the consensus sequence determine they ability to be recognize and splice . ise/iss -3 have a notably high GU content , with g or u comprise 74 % of its nucleotide . while we minigene contain both exon iiib and iiic indicate that these combine activity can occur on the same pre-mrna , the fact that activation of a upstream exon or repression of a downstream exon by ise/iss -3 can occur independently suggest that these activity be not necessarily directly functionally couple . however , use co-transfection experiment , we have thus far not be able to demonstrate that any of these protein alone can promote exon iiib inclusion or exon iiic silencing . the fact that this element display cell-type-specific splicing regulatory function only in cell that express fgfr2-iiib -lrb- e.g. dt3 and KATO III cell -rrb- suggest that factor that bind this element be centrally involve in the regulation of cell-type-specific splicing of these exon . although splice site selection be believe to generally be regulate at early step in spliceosome assembly , the recent demonstration that the drosophila splicing factor SXL can silence splicing at the second step of splicing _ in vitro _ have set a precedent for regulation of splicing after the first step . additionally , while the ability of ise/iss -3 to repress exon iiic splicing involve a suboptimal bp in its native context , it can also repress exon iiic contain a optimal bp and a suboptimal ppt . the design of this minigene establish a open reading frame in the 5  exon that , when exon 33.51 be skip -lrb- or not present as in  exon 33.51 -rrb- , do not maintain a open reading frame encode egfp . therefore , further study be need to determine whether additional factor that bind the element be require for its function , or whether post-translational modification may influence the ability of these protein to modulate splicing . these mutation be introduce in a modify version of the heterologous minigene describe previously . these result be most consistent with a mechanism of exon iiic silencing by inhibition at or prior to the first step of splicing . Into each of the result minigene we insert the wild-type ise/iss -3 , ise/iss -3 with mut 13 or the unrelated bg control sequence . when all upstream element as well as ise/iss -3 be present , 73 % of the product skip exon iiic -lrb- , lane 1 -rrb- . therefore , exon iiic silencing involve ise/iss -3 prevent use of its associated 3  splice site at or prior to the first step of splicing . in at3 cell , over 90 % exon iiic inclusion be maintain when either the bp or the PPT be ` suboptimal ' regardless of the presence of ise/iss -3 -lrb- , lane 1 -- 3 and 10 -- 12 -rrb- . pi-11-fs-cx , pi-11-fs-cxs-iiib mut , pi-xn-33 .51 - if5 , pi-11-f and pi-11 -lrb- - h3 -rrb- pl-3ct construct be describe previously . this feature , whereby fluorescence can directly assay the ability of a intronic element to regulate splicing indicate its potential for broader use in study of splicing regulation of other transcript and regulatory element . when the wild-type ise/iss -3 element be insert back in its normal position in intron 8 , splicing of exon iiib be restore with 81 % of product now splicing exon iiib in preference to exon iiic -lrb- , lane b -rrb- . despite grow appreciation of the relevance of alternative splicing to normal development as well as its role in disease , the molecular mechanism that control this process in mammalian cell be poorly understand . the ise/iss -3 fragment present in and c and figure 4 be a 105 nt insert obtain by pcr of pi-11-f with ise3-cla-f2 -lrb- 5  - catcgatgtgtggtgatgggcctgcag-3  -rrb- and ise3-xho-r4 -lrb- 5  - ctcgaggtgctggccatcaggagatt-3  -rrb- primer and insertion into the clai/xhoi site of the indicate minigene . we previously demonstrate that exon iiic silencing be facilitate by the highly atypical use of a guanine as the primary branch nucleotide and suggest that this may indicate that its silencing be effect during the second step of splicing . a general model of splicing regulation have emerge whereby splicing regulatory factor influence the ability of the basal splicing machinery to recognize consensus sequence element present at exon/intron -lrb- the 5  splice site -rrb- and intron/exon boundary -lrb- the 3  splice site -rrb- . the GU to ac mutant result in a partial abrogation of the ability of ise/iss -3 to repress exon iiic , similar to its ability to impair exon 33.51 activation -lrb- , lane 3 -rrb- . after several structural rearrangement , the two catalytic step of splicing be carry out . together , these consensus sequence be require for recruitment of the spliceosome , the macromolecular machine that perform the catalytic step of splicing . use rna affinity chromatography , we have thus far identify tls/fus , ENSEMBLGENE and ENSEMBLGENE as protein that bind the wild-type , but not the 5  ac mutant , ise/iss -3 sequence . to determine whether ise/iss -3 mediate repression of exon iiic require cooperation by these upstream _ ci - _ element , we make a series of minigene in which we sequentially shorten intron 8 upstream of ise/iss -3 . we stably transfect dt3 cell with both type of minigene and determine the degree to which the mutation influence the ability of ise/iss -3 to enhance or silence splicing of a upstream or downstream exon , respectively . interestingly , we note a excellent correlation between the MFI in pooled stably transfect cell and the level of inclusion of a heterologous exon as determine by rt -- pcr . to simplify comparison we present the result for exon iiic repression as the percent of skip -lrb- relative to exon iiic inclusion -rrb- and for activation as the percent troponin exon inclusion -lrb- relative to skip -rrb- . to study activation we use a previously describe heterologous minigene , pi-xn-33 .51 - if5 in which we insert ise/iss -3 downstream of a troponin exon -lrb- exon 33.51 -rrb- and determine the amount of its inclusion versus skip . we again observe minimal exon 33.51 inclusion in the absence of ise/iss -3 , but over 50 % inclusion when it be present -lrb- and d , lane 2 and 3 -rrb- . however , it be also noteworthy that the ppt associate with the 3  splice site of exon iiic be very uridine rich , as have be show to be optimal for selection of a 3  splice site . therefore , we result would suggest that while a weak branchpoint be one feature of exon iiic that present a opportunity for ise/iss -3 to silence its inclusion , other sequence component -lrb- e.g. a weak 5  splice site -rrb- that similarly impair the kinetics of spliceosome assembly may also facilitate its silencing . the fact that only 3 g residue interrupt a stretch of 25 pyrimidine in this ppt indicate that it be a ` strong ' _ ci _ - act determinant of exon iiic splicing . however , in each case the ability of ise/iss -3 to promote exon iiic skip be preserve as evidence by the fact that exon skip be significantly decrease when it be mutate or replace . previously publish relative efficiency of the two step of splicing with all four branch nucleotide be determine use pre-mrna substrate unrelated to those describe here . fluorescent minigene contain wild-type or mutate ise/iss -3 be stably transfect in dt3 cell and exon 33.51 inclusion be determine by rt -- pcr . we observe no significant exon 33.51 inclusion and negligible fluorescence in at3 cell stably transfect with these same minigene -lrb- datum not show -rrb- . we also analyze the same set of stably transfect cell by flow cytometry to determine whether the level of green fluorescence in pooled cell stably express the minigene construct be a reliable indicator of the level of exon 33.51 splicing . in fact , numerous study have indicate that strong ppt can compensate for weak bpss , and _ vice versa _ , suggest that these two element collectively contribute to 3  splice site recognition . note that , in contrast to previous figure in which we present exon iiic skip , we will henceforth present level of exon iiic inclusion . transfection of dt3 and at3 cell , rna purification and rt -- pcr analysis of minigene splicing be perform as describe previously . the ise/iss -3 element be of particular interest as it appear that splicing regulatory protein -lrb- s -rrb- that bind it can simultaneously achieve such dual role from a single position in a manner that appear to be determine by its position relative to the regulate exon . in the absence of ise/iss -3 , we note that only 25 % of splice product contain exon iiib in dt3 cell ; thus , 75 % of splice product instead contain exon iiic -lrb- , lane a -rrb- . . we find that mutation of all GU or UG dinucleotide in the 5  half of the element be sufficient to abolish ise activity , whereas mutation in the 3  half only partially impair its function -lrb- and d , lane 4 -- 9 -rrb- . when result from the entire set of minigene be examine , we observe a excellent correlation between relative MFI by flow cytometric analysis and exon 33.51 inclusion determine by rt -- pcr -lrb- and f , compare graph -rrb- . we result indicate that gu-rich sequence motif within ise/iss -3 enhance splicing of a upstream exon and repress splicing of a downstream exon and be most consistent with a model in which factor that bind ise/iss -3 be involve in both activity and that the primary determinant as to whether the element function as a enhancer or silencer be its position relative to a regulate exon . polypyrimidine tract-binding protein repress splicing of a fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 gene alternative exon through exon sequence here , we have perform comprehensive mutational analysis to define critical sequence motif within this element that independently either enhance splicing of upstream exon or repress splicing of downstream exon . another recent study show that intronic ac-rich element function as either ise or isss depend on they proximity to a regulate 5  splice site , a effect likely to be mediate by hnRNP L. however , the mechanism by which these regulator can function to activate or repress splicing remain unclear . such analysis include use of a novel fluorescence-based splicing reporter assay that allow quantitative determination of relative functional activity of ise/iss -3 mutant use flow cytometric analysis of live cell . we previously define a minimal 85 nt sequence that be sufficient to carry out these regulatory activity . to facilitate comparison of rt -- pcr to mean fluorescence intensity -lrb- mfus -rrb- as a means of determine relative level exon 33.51 inclusion , we normalize the result for each minigene to that obtain with the minigene contain the wild-type ise/iss -3 element . this heterologous minigene also include ENSEMBLGENE intron 8 _ ci _ - element located upstream of ise/iss -3 such that the context of its function relative to the regulate exon be similar to that in its endogenous position . the control BG fragment -lrb- 105 nt -rrb- be obtain by pcr of the second intron of human -globin gene with bg-105-f -lrb- 5  - ccgggcggccgctatacttaatgccttaacat-3  -rrb- and bg-105-r -lrb- 5  - ccgcatcgatgattgtagctgctattagca-3  -rrb- primer . to study repression we use a minigene , pi-11-fs-cxs-iiib-mut , in which both the 3  and 5  splice site of exon iiib be mutate to preclude exon iiib splicing . therefore , we conclude that the ise/iss -3 element can repress splicing of the downstream exon iiic independent of the other intron 8 element describe here . Representative flow cytometric analysis use several minigene be show in to demonstrate the ability to easily detect increase fluorescence in response to ise/iss -3 mediate enhancement of exon 33.51 inclusion . this design ensure that essentially all cell that survive in selective media express the minigene since the minigene and the selectable marker be translate from a single transcript . esss within exon iiic have previously be describe that may cooperate with ise/iss -3 to assemble a repressor complex that prevent exon iiic inclusion . this be the only describe example in which a g be use as the primary branch nucleotide during splicing of a mammalian pre-mrna . it be noteworthy that the construct use to demonstrate ise/iss -3 mediated activation of exon 33.51 splicing do not contain any downstream ENSEMBLGENE sequence whereas the 4 construct show here to repress exon iiic do not contain any upstream ENSEMBLGENE sequence . several combinatorial model have be propose by which factor bind to exon -lrb- esss -rrb- and intron -lrb- isss -rrb- cooperatively prevent exon definition . when the sequence upstream of ise/iss -3 be progressively delete in the presence of the wild-type ise/iss -3 element a gradual decrease in the amount of exon iiic skip be observe -lrb- , lane 4 , 7 and 10 -rrb- .

ENSEMBLGENE may affect the bone development via interaction with ENSEMBLGENE -lrb- runt-related transcription factor 2 -rrb- . dna hypermethylation in the regulatory region have be find to be the cause of down-modulation of wwox expression in prostate cancer-derived cell . the ENSEMBLGENE expression be associate with the hormone receptor status . however , the underlie mechanism for the regulation of the association between ENSEMBLGENE and er status be not clear . in addition , loss of ENSEMBLGENE expression induce the release of ap2 transcription factor protein to the nucleus and the up-regulation of epidermal receptor-2 -lrb- her2 -rrb- . Cisplatin be among the most widely use chemotherapeutic agent for cancer . . transient overexpression experiment have show that WWOX suppress the transcriptional function of these protein by sequester they in the cytoplasm of cell . the WWOX -  np63 interaction lead to increase chemosenstivity to cisplatin and a increase cell death rate . it have be demonstrate that ENSEMBLGENE can physically interact via its first ww domain with p73 . increase her2 enhance the agonistic activity against endocrine therapy for breast cancer , indicate that ENSEMBLGENE may mediate tamoxifen resistance via interaction with ap2 , -lrb- Fig . -rrb- reduce ENSEMBLGENE expression demonstrate a significant correlation with the clinical stage of the cancer , negative er status and poor survival . reduce ENSEMBLGENE expression be associate with carcinogenesis and progression of various cancer . thus , the expression status of ENSEMBLGENE have a effect on cancer progression and prognosis . loss of ENSEMBLGENE expression may up-regulate er transcriptional activity and induce tamoxifen resistance . the ww domain binding protein-2 -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- may be a key regulatory protein . er or pr positive cancer have a higher level of wwox expression than er or pr negative cancer .  np63 , a transcription factor localized in the nucleus , play a crucial role in determine cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agent . fss be subdivide into common and rare fragile site accord to they occurrence frequency in the human population . the focus of this review be to summarize the role of ENSEMBLGENE in metabolic disease and tumor development . fra16d , the second highly express CFS , encompass the ENSEMBLGENE gene encode a ww domain-containing oxidoreductase . thus , ENSEMBLGENE be essential for gonadal development and function . overexpression of WWOX in DU145/LNCaP/PC -3 -lrb- wwox negative DETECTEDPHENO cancer cell -rrb- significantly reduce the number of cancer cell colony , lead to apoptosis through caspase-dependent mechanism . the ENSEMBLGENE gene alternatively knock out in mouse be commonly use to study the role of ENSEMBLGENE in steroid metabolism . cfss be component of normal chromosome structure and be not the result of the expansion of repeat sequence . WWOX deficient mouse be bear with gonad abnormality , include failure of Leydig cell development in testis and reduction of theca cell proliferation in ovary . knockout -lrb- ko -rrb- mouse may suffer from impaired mammary branch morphogenesis due to the haploinsuffisiency of ENSEMBLGENE in the mouse mammary gland . common fragile site -lrb- cf -rrb- be see in all individual , while rare fragile site -lrb- rf -rrb- be find in less than 5 % of the human population . Tyr -lrb- 33 -rrb- and tyr -lrb- 287 -rrb- be the known site of ENSEMBLGENE phosphorylation . in addition , ENSEMBLGENE be involve in steroid hormone metabolism . the full-length ENSEMBLGENE , which encode a 414 amino acid protein , possess two typical n-terminal ww domain -lrb- first domain , amino acid 17-49 ; second domain , amino acid 58-90 -rrb- , a c-terminal short-chain dehydrogenase reductase -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- domain , and a nuclear localization sequence -lrb- nl -rrb- -lrb- fig . -rrb- fragile site -lrb- fss -rrb- be chromosome region that exhibit a increase occurrence frequency of gap or break when expose to extrinsic or intrinsic dna replication inhibitor such as brdu , 5-azacytidine , aphidicolin and hypoxium . a nuclear localization sequence -lrb- nl -rrb- be located between the two ww domain . meanwhile , WWOX have be find to be highly express in hormone-dependent tissue , such as the prostate , mammary gland and ovary , and secretory epithelial cell of endocrine and exocrine tissue . it have be find that treatment of WWOX /  np63-expressing cancer cell with cisplatin can increase the cell death by 14 fold , as compare with treatment of  np63 expressing cell alone . numerous study have show that ENSEMBLGENE be a important tumor suppressor and that loss or deregulation of ENSEMBLGENE contribute to development of various tumor . the ENSEMBLGENE protein with a classcial ENSEMBLGENE domain be associate with oxidation and reduction of lipid hormone . however , the e3 ubiquitin ligase need for ENSEMBLGENE ubiquitination have not be identify . the ENSEMBLGENE distribution pattern lead to the speculation that this protein be perhaps involve in regulation of the activity of metabolic steroid or steroid receptor . loss of wwox induce reduce level of the testosterone and affect the normal function of the prostate . be ENSEMBLGENE dehydrogenase/reductase activity related to its tumor suppressive function ? nevertheless , the function of ENSEMBLGENE ENSEMBLGENE domain be still unclear . ENSEMBLGENE - / - mouse show reduce expression of key steroidogenesis enzyme , include cyp11a1 -lrb- cytochrome p450 , family 11 , subfamily a , polypeptide 1 -rrb- , cyp17a1 -lrb- cytochrome p450 , family 17 , subfamily a , polypeptide 1 -rrb- , and hsd3b6 -lrb- 3-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase -rrb- . ENSEMBLGENE be a principal transcriptional regulator of osteoblast differentiation and have be find to be responsible for metabolic bone abnormality of ENSEMBLGENE - / - mouse . activate cdc42-associated kinase -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- can phosphorylate ENSEMBLGENE at tyr33 and tyr287 , and the tyr287 phosphorylation process be associate with ENSEMBLGENE polyubiquitination and degradation . immunohistochemical staining have show strong ENSEMBLGENE expression in the normal human ovarian tissue , but lack of or barely detectable ENSEMBLGENE expression in 37 % of tumor . eighty-four percent of DETECTEDPHENO cancer have down-modulate ENSEMBLGENE . esophageal squamous cell carcinoma , non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer show a high loss of heterozygosity -lrb- loh -rrb- , a low mutation rate and the expression of aberrant transcript of the ENSEMBLGENE gene . the wild-type ENSEMBLGENE protein contain 414 amino acid and possess two n-terminal ww domain -lrb- first domain , amino acid 17-49 ; second domain , amino acid 58-90 -rrb- and a c-terminal short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase reductase -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- domain . wwox expression may predict benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen in randomize breast cancer patient effect of WWOX gene on the attachment and adhesion of ovarian cancer cell WWOX can interact via the ww domain with protein that possess proline ppxy motif and be involve in a variety of cellular process . the wwox mrna and protein expression in prostate cancer cell can be increase by 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine -lrb- aza -rrb- , a dna methytransferase inhibitor . reduce or lose expression of ENSEMBLGENE will lead to development of metabolic disease . . the ENSEMBLGENE gene span a genomic locus of more than 1 mbp encode a open reading frame of 1.2 kb , and consist of 9 code exon in a region of approximately one million base pair . loss of ENSEMBLGENE expression activate runx2-mediated transcription activity , enhance the expression level of downstream target gene , include vegf and osteocalcin , , and induce bone metabolic defect . northern blot and rt-pcr analysis of the breast and ovarian cancer cell have reveal that the presence of transcript of smaller size represent abnormally splice version of ENSEMBLGENE . it have be report that reduce expression of key steroidogenesis enzyme be the main reason for abnormal leydig cell and decrease level of testosterone in WWOX - / - mouse . answer to these question will help to further understand the role of ENSEMBLGENE in metabolic disease and tumor . ENSEMBLGENE tyr33 phosphorylation can be stimulate by steriod hormone 17-estradiol -lrb- e2 -rrb- independent of the estrogen receptor -lrb- er -rrb- . endogenous wwox remain in mitochondrium in culture normal cell line such as epidermal keratinocyte and mammary gland cell , and be translocate to nucleus under tumor necrosis factor- -lrb- tnf -rrb- stimulation . the first n-terminal ww domain be need for the classical ww-ppxy interaction . pro-apoptotic regent phorobol myristate acetate -lrb- pma -rrb- induce dissociation of the mek / WWOX complex , release WWOX to mitochondrium and cause apoptosis in jurkat t cell . ENSEMBLGENE -lrb- 3p14 .2 -rrb- , fra16d -lrb- 16q23 .2 -rrb- and fraxb -lrb- xp21 .1 -rrb- be currently the most characteristic cfss . WWOX can also be translocate into the nucleus upon tyr33 phosphorylation induce by anisomycin or uv light at the first n-terminal ww domain of WWOX in l929 fibroblast and other cell line . heterozygous ENSEMBLGENE ko mouse have increase incidence of spontaneous tumor . loss or dysregulation of ENSEMBLGENE expression also lead to genomic instability , tumorigenesis , cancer progression and resistance to therapy . CFS gene ENSEMBLGENE have a critical role in steroid and bone metabolism . the protein with the ENSEMBLGENE domain be involve in oxidation and reduction of various substrate such as lipid hormone , sugar , alcohol and retinoid . ENSEMBLGENE may affect tumorigenesis by inhibit activity of some protein , include p73 , erbb4 , ap-2 and other transcription factor . the subcellular localization and function of ENSEMBLGENE be regulate by its phosphorylation . . wwox tumour suppressor gene polymorphism and ovarian cancer pathology and prognosis ENSEMBLGENE have be show to be involve in pro-apoptotic progression . biophysical basis of the binding of wwox tumor suppressor to wbp1 and wbp2 adaptor ENSEMBLGENE protein expression vary among rcc histotype and downregulation of ENSEMBLGENE protein correlate with less-favorable prognosis in clear rcc wwox bind to the classic ww-ppxy motif of wbp2 and may down-regulate er and pr transactivation pathway by suppress the activity of coactivator ENSEMBLGENE . mouse with a homozygous deletion of WWOX show reduced serum calcium , hypoproteinurium , and DETECTEDPHENO , lead to development of metabolic bone disease . tyr287 phosphorylation process be associate with ENSEMBLGENE polyubiquitination and degradation . therefore , ENSEMBLGENE may regulate steroid metabolism by regulation of activity of key steroidogenesis enzyme . ENSEMBLGENE - / - mouse also suffer a disorder of skeleton development and increase osteoclast activity , characterize by thinner cortical bone and DETECTEDPHENO mineral density and bone volume . be ENSEMBLGENE ENSEMBLGENE domain related to the function of hormone receptor and endocrine therapy resistance ? cytoplasmic p73 contribute to the apoptotic activity of ENSEMBLGENE . reduce protein level of WWOX increase migration of cancer cell through the basal membrane . another future research direction may be to develop a tissue-specific -lrb- for example : hormone-related tissue -rrb- conditional knockout mouse model for further analysis of the role of ENSEMBLGENE in tissue development and metabolic disease and for description of the biological function of the ENSEMBLGENE domain in vivo . 26.2 % of er+pr + breast carcinoma and 50.9 % of er-pr - case be completely negative for ENSEMBLGENE expression . in this review , we focus on the role of ENSEMBLGENE in metabolic disorder and tumor . in addition , the signal network of ENSEMBLGENE be still unclear . 49.2 % of er + breast carcinoma and 26.6 % of er - case be strongly positive for ENSEMBLGENE expression . loss of wwox expression induce the membranous intergrin 3 protein expression and modulate the interaction between cancer cell and ecm , result in migration of cancer cell through the basal membrane . further research be need to elucidate the signaling network to shed light upon the role of ENSEMBLGENE in metabolic disease and tumor . tamoxifen be the first choice as a selective estrogen receptor modulator -lrb- serm -rrb- in clinical practice for endocrine treatment of early and advanced breast cancer . the ENSEMBLGENE protein be associate with oxidation and reduction of lipid hormone since it contain the classcial ENSEMBLGENE domain . reduce or lose expression of ENSEMBLGENE will lead to development of metabolic disease . the strong association of ENSEMBLGENE expression with er status suggest that ENSEMBLGENE may affect tamoxifen endocrine therapy for breast cancer . therefore , ENSEMBLGENE can be use as a marker for poor prognosis or unfavorable clinical outcome . ENSEMBLGENE can enhance the activity of key steroidogenesis enzyme transcriptional activity of run2 . ENSEMBLGENE be highly express in hormone-dependent tissue and perhaps involve in regulation of activity of metabolic steroid . thus , WWOX may help maintain the sensitivity of cancer cell to chemotherapeutic drug . accumulate evidence have show that ENSEMBLGENE that contain a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- domain be involve in steroid metabolism and bone development . the underlie mechanism be probably that ENSEMBLGENE suppress the transcriptional ability of  np63 by sequester it in the cytoplasm . when mouse be give a single dose of enu -lrb- powerful chemical mutagen -rrb- , 17.2 % -lrb- 10/58 -rrb- of the heterozygous ENSEMBLGENE ko mouse develop papillary carcinoma of the lung , compare with 3.3 % -lrb- 2/60 -rrb- of the wide type . inhibition of endogenous wwox expression result in stimulation of the transcriptional activity of the wnt/beta-catenin pathway . effect of exogenous e2f-1 on the expression of common chromosome fragile site gene , FHIT and WWOX ENSEMBLGENE heterozygous knockout mouse show a increase incidence of spontaneous or induced tumor . WWOX , a gene that span the second most common chromosomal fragile site -lrb- fra16d -rrb- , often exhibit homozygous deletion and translocation breakpoint under multiple cellular stress induce by extrinsic or intrinsic factor , such as hypoxium , uv , and dna damage regent . bouteille n et al , use the two-hybrid system and coimmunoprecipitation assay , have verify that WWOX physically associate with dishevelled -lrb- dvl -rrb- protein , which be involve in the wnt / beta-catenin pathway , and inhibit the nuclear import of dvl protein . exogenous wwox expression suppress cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis . loss of ENSEMBLGENE be closely related to genomic instability , tumorigenesis , cancer progression and therapy resistance . ENSEMBLGENE protein expression be lose or reduce in nearly 100 % of metastatic cancer tissue . to investigate the correlation of wwox expression with the outcome of tamoxifen treatment , Gothlin ea et al have examine paraffin-embedded tissue from 912 randomize breast cancer patient . WWOX be involve in cell cycle and apoptotic process by interact with the protein that poss ppxy motif , include  np63 , erbb4 , ap-2 , run2 and c-jun . abnormal activation of wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway be closely related to tumorigenesis and tumor development . Intergrin 3 be a transmembrane receptor that mediate the attachment between cell and extracellular matrix -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- and play a vital role in migration and tumor invasion . ENSEMBLGENE have a critical role in cancer metastasis and invasion . the wwox protein expression level have be analyze by use immunohistochemistry and statistic evaluation , and they result indicate that patient with high expression of WWOX may gain more benefit from tamoxifen treatment . Research have find that the status of er and pr in breast carcinoma be correlate with loss of ENSEMBLGENE expression . the above literature review show that ENSEMBLGENE , as a chromosomal fragile site gene , can increase the sensitivity to endocrine therapy and chemotherapy for tumor . tamoxifen function as a competitive inhibitor of er and repress the er transcriptional activity . ENSEMBLGENE can sequester they in the cytoplasm and suppress they transcriptional function . take together , reduce or lose expression of ENSEMBLGENE will lead to development of metabolic disease due to the role of the ENSEMBLGENE domain-containing protein ENSEMBLGENE in steroid metabolism and bone development . src kinase phosphorylate ENSEMBLGENE at Y33 in the first ww domain and src-mediated phosphorylation of ENSEMBLGENE enhance its binding to p73 . thus , ENSEMBLGENE suppress tumorigenicity through down-regulation of onco-protein by protein-protein interaction . WWOX physically interact with mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 -lrb- mek1 -rrb- , which be located in the lipid raft of the cell membrane . furthermore , expression of ENSEMBLGENE lead to sequestration of p73 from nuclear to cytoplasm and its cytoplastic colocalization with ENSEMBLGENE . loss or deregulation of wwox expression be associate with the development of various cancer type and cancer cell line , include pancreatic adenocarcinoma , renal cell carcinoma and endocrine and exocrine carcinoma , -lrb- Tab . -rrb- as a coactivator for er and pr transactivation pathway , ENSEMBLGENE physically interact with ENSEMBLGENE and activate steroid hormone receptor . .

23866929	JOURNAL_Multidiscip_Respir_Med MeSH_  epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status and clinicopathological feature of combined small cell carcinoma with adenocarcinoma of the lung we describe the case of a 78-year-old woman with large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung , with mutation in exon 21 l858r and co-expression of adenocarcinoma marker . efficacy of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in a patient with metastatic small cell lung cancer currently , egfr-tkus be consider third-line chemotherapy for patient with inoperable and recurrent nsclc after first-line platinum-based combination chemotherapy and second-line chemotherapy with docetaxel ; however , in future the combination of cytotoxic agent and egfr-tkus may become first - or second-line standard chemotherapy . furthermore , a high response rate -lrb- 60 to 90 % -rrb- to treatment with egfr-tki have be observe in patient harbor mutation in exon 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase domain of ENSEMBLGENE , with exon 19 deletion and exon 21 l858r point mutation comprise about 90 % of all mutation -lrb- , -rrb- . the author have no grant for this research and no compete interest to declare . a copy of the write consent be available for review by the editor-in-chief of this journal . all author read and approve the final manuscript . available and noteworthy be two mutation-specific antibody for the detection of egfr gene mutation : anti-egfr exon 19 e746-750 deletion antibody -lrb- rabbit monoclonal , clone 6b6 , cell signaling technology  , Danvers , MA -rrb- along with anti-egfr exon 21 l858r mutation antibody -lrb- , -rrb- . epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in small cell lung cancer patient who receive surgical resection in China ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation-specific immunostaining be potentially effective and should be utilize for easy detection and further study of this rare disease . nonetheless , the detection of this disease need to be attempt through further study . immunostaining with these antibody be less costly and easier to conduct than by molecular detection of ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation , cover the two major pattern of ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation , and can be use for SCLC and LCNEC in which ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation be less frequent than in ADC . the fact that patient with lung cancer have as many therapeutic choice as possible be gratify . some case of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung harboring mutation have be sporadically report . a additional therapeutic choice for high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma show poor prognosis be expect , and egfr-tkus that be now available commercially should naturally be consider even for this carcinoma , much more than for one with adenocarcinomatous characteristic . write informed consent be obtain from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompany image . test for the presence of ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation by pcr in SCLC and LCNEC may , however , be practically difficult from the aspect of cost and rarity . high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma generally show more DETECTEDPHENO and rapid relapse than nsclc . mutation status of epidermal growth factor receptor and clinical feature of patient with combined small cell lung cancer who receive surgical treatment although the mechanism of lethal interstitial DETECTEDPHENO as a side effect of egfr-tkus be still unknown , egfr-tkus can be striking in cancer reduction and quality of life improvement in patient with advanced NSCLC harbor ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation . interestingly , we case suggest the presence of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma harbor egfr gene mutation : egfr-tkus may provide better quality of life and survival in patient with advanced or relapse high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma , particularly that with ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation . immunohistochemistry may be one of the strategy for easy detection of ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation . the prerequisite to administer egfr-tkus for NSCLC be the presence of ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation , as oppose to resistance mutation such as that of exon 20 t790m , exon 19 d761y , and exon 21t854a -lrb- , , -rrb- . anti-egfr exon 21 l858r mutation-specific immunostaining of lung adenocarcinoma demonstrate excellent sensitivity -lrb- 95.2 % -rrb- and specificity -lrb- 98.8 % -rrb- , although the former may react to exon 19 deletion overlap e746-a750 . presently there be no regimen of chemotherapy for high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma harbor ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation . nonetheless , this case might be consistently lcnec harbor egfr exon 21 l858r mutation , especially that the cytologic feature display by both test be almost the same , note specially the pcr conduct on the same tumor cell as those of the Papanicolaou preparation , and the positivity of ENSEMBLGENE exon 21 l858r mutation-specific immunostaining in the second biopsy . strikingly , fourteen -lrb- 70 % -rrb- show combined SCLC and adenocarcinoma , or suggest a transformation from adenocarcinoma to SCLC ; eleven display ENSEMBLGENE gene exon 19 deletion mutation , and eight exon 21 l858r point mutation proportionally similar to mutation in adenocarcinoma . further study be need on the occurrence of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma harbor ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation . the present case be , however , immunoreactive to adenocarcinoma marker ttf-1 , napsin a , and CEA , not to entrap non-tumor alveolar cell , which be a conspicuous finding when consider the occurrence of lcnec with ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation . indeed , high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma harbor ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation may have molecular adenocarcinomatous characteristic , at least by derivation from the literature about case like the present one . interestingly , case report of small-cell lung carcinoma -lrb- sclc -rrb- harboring ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation and apparently respond to egfr-tkus have sporadically appear since 2005 -lrb- - -rrb- . adenocarcinoma might have be present before the development of lcnec and before the first biopsy . neuroendocrine proliferative pattern , such as organoid one and nuclear molding , be not identify in the whole section of the surgical specimen . thyroid transcription factor-1 be diffusely and strongly positive in the cell . moreover , a few case of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma -lrb- lcnec -rrb- with ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation have recently be identify -lrb- - -rrb- , a additional case of which be describe here . the patient receive four cycle of systemic chemotherapy with carboplatin -lrb- area under curve 5 -rrb- and etoposide -lrb- 80 mg/m2 -rrb- for three month , at the end of which the size of the tumor decrease by one half . retrospectively , the cell subject of the second examination show almost the same morphology as that of cell of the first test regardless of artifactual degeneration . also , the clonal relation between the first and second test be not clear because the mutational status of the ENSEMBLGENE gene in the second biopsy be not address by pcr . accord to the statement of the International Association for the study of lung cancer/american thoracic society/european respiratory Society about lung adc -lrb- -rrb- , egfr gene mutation should be routinely examine in all patient with nsclc before nonsurgical treatment and after the initiation of egfr-tkus therapy , with a view of predict reactivity and resistance to egfr-tkus , if possible , with the use of Kirsten rat sarcoma virus oncogene homolog -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- rearrangement -lrb- - -rrb- . it can be assume that the present case be consistently adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation harbor ENSEMBLGENE exon 21 l858r mutation . whether lcnec with ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation be relate to adenocarcinoma be still unknown , although only one case have suggest transformation from adenocarcinoma to lcnec -lrb- -rrb- . the mechanism and significance of ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation in LCNEC be still unknown . second-line chemotherapy be under consideration at present . among these sclc case , the ratio of male : female be 1:3 -lrb- age 60.9  26.1 year ; range , 36 -- 89 -rrb- , and of smoker : non-smoker 2:3 . distinctly , the detection of egfr exon 21 l858r mutation by pcr on the first specimen might have be due to the very few adenocarcinoma cell , combine type with adenocarcinoma . ENSEMBLGENE l858r mutation be detect in exon 21 -lrb- pna lna pcr-clamp method -rrb- of another brushing and DETECTEDPHENO specimen . at a follow-up examination one and half year earlier , chest compute tomography show a mass -lrb- 1.5 cm in diameter -rrb- in the inferior lobe of the left lung . it have double in size within the follow four month , and positron emission tomography -lrb- pet -rrb- and magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- MRI -rrb- reveal metastase to ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node . a 78-year-old japanese woman ex-smoker -lrb- half a pack per day -rrb- with past history of pulmonary tuberculosis and uterine leiomyoma have be under medical treatment for chronic DETECTEDPHENO failure with DETECTEDPHENO fibrillation , unstable angina , eosinophilic DETECTEDPHENO , DETECTEDPHENO asthma , DETECTEDPHENO , DETECTEDPHENO , and DETECTEDPHENO . the entry of tyrosine kinase inhibitor -lrb- tki -rrb- gefitinib -lrb- iressa  , AstraZeneca , Wilmington , Delaware -rrb- and erlotinib -lrb- Tarceva  , Genentech , South San Francisco , California -rrb- , which target epidermal growth factor receptor -lrb- egfr -rrb- , be one of the most recent , gratifying event in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer -lrb- nsclc -rrb- . re-enlargement of the cancer and bone metastase be observe after chemotherapy , and further testing suggest large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with immunoreactivity to marker of primary lung adenocarcinoma and l858r mutation . further study in this respect be warrant . a mass -lrb- 3.0 cm in diameter -rrb- be identify in the inferior lobe of the left lung , accompany by metastase into ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node and elevation of serum pro-gastrin-releasing peptide and carcinoembryonic antigen . nonetheless , twenty case of sclc with ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation have be report and be use in this discussion -lrb- Table -rrb- -lrb- - -rrb- . Ours may be the first in a ex-smoker with lcnec harbor exon 21 l858r point mutation . transbronchial brushing and needle aspiration against the tumor demonstrate small cell with a high nuclear/cytoplasm ratio and fine granular nuclear chromatin scatter around a large cell cluster in poorly smear Papanicolaou stain , suggest high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma favor small-cell carcinoma -lrb- figure , upper panel -rrb- . consequently , the tumor be diagnose as large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma . with the present case we aim to demonstrate a possible additional case of lcnec with ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation . interestingly , ENSEMBLGENE and napsin a be also focally positive . a high rate of response to treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor -lrb- egfr-tkus -rrb- have be observe in certain patient -lrb- woman , of east asian ethnicity , with non-smoking history and adenocarcinoma histology -rrb- with mutation in exon 18 to 21 of the tyrosine kinase domain of ENSEMBLGENE . the mechanism by which SCLC acquire ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation be still unknown , but such case may occur in association with ADC . egfr-tkus could provide better quality of life and survival in patient with advanced or relapse high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with ENSEMBLGENE gene mutation . initial transbronchial brushing cytology suggest high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma favor small-cell carcinoma in poorly smear and degenerate preparation , and reveal exon 21 l858r mutation . high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of ENSEMBLGENE may be associate with adenocarcinoma , as review from the literature and may also apply to we case . clinical trial have reveal significant variability in response to egfr-tki , and patient characteristic such as sex , dominantly female , east asian ethnicity , non-smoking history , and adenocarcinoma -lrb- adc -rrb- histology have be associate with a increase likelihood of egfr-tkus effectiveness -lrb- - -rrb- . it be noteworthy that the mutation-specific immunostaining for the detection of egfr exon 21 l858r mutation -lrb- rabbit monoclonal antibody , 1:100 , clone 43b2 , cell signaling technology  , Danvers , MA -rrb- be positive -lrb- figure -rrb- . histopathologic and cytologic follow up examination be carry out : Papanicolaou smear reveal cell larger than those at previous examination , and numerous scatter sheet-like arrangement . immunohistochemical analysis show tumor cell immunoreactivity to three neuroendocrine marker : chromogranin a , synaptophysin , and ENSEMBLGENE -lrb- figure -rrb- . the primary lesion have double again during the follow four month with enlargement of mediastinal lymph node . the cell have fine granular nuclear chromatin and prominent large nucleoli of a high nuclear/cytoplasm ratio and relatively rich cytoplasm -lrb- figure , lower panel -rrb- . transbronchial lung biopsy fail to provide detailed histology of the tumor cell because of insufficient sampling volume , and proliferative pattern such as organoid structure and nuclear molding could not be identify . serum tumor marker be as follow : pro-gastrin-releasing peptide 105 pg/ml -lrb- standard range 0 -- 80 -rrb- , carcinoembryonic antigen -lrb- cea -rrb- 21.8 ng/ml -lrb- 0 -- 5.2 -rrb- , and cytokeratin 19 fragment 3.0 ng/ml -lrb- 0 -- 2 -rrb- .

Artemis be ubiquitously express and be localized in the nucleus . Artemis belong to the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily and define a new group , beta-casp , within this family . two of these patient develop aggressive b cell lymphoma , a condition that suggest Artemis may be consider a `` caretaker '' factor , similarly to the other v -lrb- d -rrb- j recombination/dna repair actor . while rs-scid patient harbor Artemis loss-of-function mutation , we identify four patient with a DETECTEDPHENO immunodeficiency characterize by a low but detectable number of both b and t lymphocyte cause by hypomorphic mutation in the Artemis gene . beta-casp protein be beta-lactamase act on nucleic acid . the v -lrb- d -rrb- j recombination/dna repair factor artemi belong to the metallo-beta-lactamase family and constitute a critical developmental checkpoint of the lymphoid system .

Melanocortin receptor-1 gene polymorphism and the risk of cutaneous melanoma in a low-risk southern european population . in conclusion , ENSEMBLGENE polymorphism be a predisposing factor of melanoma in a southern european population with a relatively low incidence of the disease . the risk of melanoma be enhance in individual carry multiple variant allele -lrb- or = 6.97 ; 95 % ci = 1.86-26 .12 , p = 0.004 -rrb- . the entire ENSEMBLGENE gene be sequence for polymorphism and the result be correlate with host factor and pigmentary characteristic . individual with melanocortin 1 receptor -lrb- ENSEMBLGENE -rrb- gene variant have be show to carry a increase risk for the development of melanoma . in stratified analysis , the risk of melanoma among ENSEMBLGENE carrier be not influence by skin phototype , skin color , or hair color . mc1r polymorphism be present in 59.4 % of melanoma patient compare to 37.5 % of control , yield a odds ratio -lrb- or -rrb- of 2.43 -lrb- 95 % confidence interval -lrb- ci -rrb- = 1.50-3 .96 , p < 0.001 -rrb- for melanoma among ENSEMBLGENE carrier . in this study , we investigate the relationship of mc1r gene variant and the risk of melanoma in 123 melanoma patient and 155 control subject from Greece .
