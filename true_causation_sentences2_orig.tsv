18360822	Abstract.0	1	A new c. 740G > A -LRB- R247H -RRB- mutation in OPA1 alternate spliced exon 5b was found in a patient presenting with bilateral optic neuropathy followed by partial , spontaneous visual recovery .
14661542	Abstract.2	1	The Pro 23 His and Pro 347 Leu mutations in the rhodopsin gene are representative mutations for ADRP in other countries , but the mutation in the rhodopsin gene is very rare in Japanese patients with ADRP .
19175693	Body.0	134	The small number of patients with _ JAK2 _ exon 12 mutations are more likely to present with isolated erythrocytosis but there is substantial phenotypic overlap with _ JAK2_V617F-positive PV -LRB- -RRB- .
10393054	Abstract.3	1	The results show that PDE6C was not the site of the amutations responsible for the types of inherited retinal degenerations analyzed in the large population of patients ` in the present study .
20803142	Body.0	134	Thus far , the vast majority of _ ELANE _ mutations in SCN were found in sporadic cases and occasionally a small nuclear family was found in which the mutation was present in one parent and one or two children .
24997722	Body.0	2	Among the 223 reported _ EMD _ mutations in the Leiden Open Variation Database -LRB- LOVD -RRB- , the overwhelming majority of mutations have been identified in EDMD patients who presented childhood-onset contractures of the elbows , Achilles tendons and post-cervical muscles , slowly progressive muscle weakness with humeroperoneal distribution in adolescence and cardiomyopathy with conduction block in early adulthood -LRB- , -RRB- .
24997722	Body.0	88	Different from the typical clinical features caused by the majority of reported _ EMD _ mutations , the patients in our study present severe DCM but very mild skeletal muscle disorder .
21685205	Ref.3	1	A mutation in human VAP-B -- MSP domain , present in ALS patients , affects the interaction with other cellular proteins
21525970	Abstract.0	2	The aims of the study were : -LRB- i -RRB- to evaluate the clinical phenotype of LS in a newly identified Italian family of Sicilian origin carrying a gain-of-function mutation of the β subunit of the epithelial sodium channel -LRB- ENaC -RRB- -LRB- P617L -RRB- previously reported by our group in an apparently unrelated Sicilian patient presenting the typical phenotype of LS including hypokalemia ; -LRB- ii -RRB- to determine whether an unknown biological relationship exists between the newly identified family and the family of the proband previously reported .
23043190	Abstract.3	4	Two PRKAR1A patients each with a novel mutation presented a specific pattern of brachydactyly .
23437219	Body.0	37	In 16 patients with HAE from seven families , a mutation in _ SERPING1 _ responsible for the disease distinct for each family was identified , whereas no mutations were present in healthy relatives and controls .
24997722	Body.0	77	However , different from the typical EDMD clinical features caused by most reported _ EMD _ mutations , the patients in our study did not present apparent skeletal muscle atrophy and contractures .
24997722	Body.0	10	Different from the typical clinical features caused by most reported _ EMD _ mutations , the patients in our study presented severe DCM but very mild skeletal atrophy .
