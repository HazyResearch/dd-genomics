Porting to ddlog:

limitations:
    - a call to an elt of a tab doesn't work. Therefore, in the extractor "non_gene_acronyms_extract_candidates", the sql query is slightly different (doesn't include gm.wordidxs[1] and a.words[a.wordidx] LIKE '-LRB-';) and the udf is slightly changed in non_gene_acronyms_extract_candidates_ddlog.py to make this comparison in the python script.
